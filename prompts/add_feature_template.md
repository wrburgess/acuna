# Template for adding features to a Ruby on Rails 8+ application

## Instructions

1. **Feature Description**: Provide a clear and concise description of the feature you want to add. Include the purpose of the feature and any specific functionality it should have.

2. **User Stories**: Write user stories to describe how users will interact with the feature. Use the format:
   - As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action], so that [achieve a goal].

3. **Technical Requirements**: Specify any technical requirements or constraints for the feature. For example:
   - Database changes (e.g., new tables, columns, or indexes).
   - Stimulus controllers or Hotwire streams to be implemented.
   - API endpoints to be created or updated.

4. **UI/UX Design**: Describe the user interface and user experience for the feature. Include:
   - Wireframes or mockups (if available).
   - Any specific design elements or styles to follow.

5. **Acceptance Criteria**: Define the criteria that must be met for the feature to be considered complete. Use the format:
   - Given [context], when [action], then [expected outcome].

6. **Testing**: Specify how the feature should be tested. Include:
   - Unit tests for models, controllers, and services.
   - Integration tests for end-to-end functionality.
   - Manual testing steps, if applicable.

7. **Deployment Considerations**: Highlight any considerations for deploying the feature to Heroku. For example:
   - Environment variables to be added or updated.
   - Add-ons or services to be configured (e.g., Redis, Sidekiq).

8. **Additional Notes**: Include any additional information or context that may be helpful for implementing the feature.

## Example

### Feature Description
Add a search bar to the players index page to allow users to search for players by name, position, or team.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to search for players by name, so that I can quickly find specific players.
- As a user, I want to filter players by position, so that I can view players in a specific role.
- As a user, I want to filter players by team, so that I can view players from a specific team.

### Technical Requirements
- Add a `search` scope to the `Player` model.
- Create a Stimulus controller for handling search input and results.
- Use Hotwire to update the players list dynamically as the user types.

### UI/UX Design
- Place the search bar at the top of the players index page.
- Use a simple input field with a placeholder text: "Search players...".
- Display search results in a table below the search bar.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given the players index page, when I type a player's name in the search bar, then the list of players updates to show matching results.
- Given the players index page, when I select a position filter, then the list of players updates to show players in that position.
- Given the players index page, when I select a team filter, then the list of players updates to show players from that team.

### Testing
- Add unit tests for the `search` scope in the `Player` model.
- Add system tests for the search functionality using Capybara.
- Manually test the search bar in different browsers to ensure compatibility.

### Deployment Considerations
- Ensure the Heroku Postgres database is indexed on the columns used for searching (e.g., `name`, `position`, `team`).

### Additional Notes
- Consider adding a debounce to the search input to reduce the number of requests sent to the server.
