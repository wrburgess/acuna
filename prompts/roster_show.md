You are a Ruby on Rails senior full-stack developer with a decade of experience with Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap

Create a view named admin/rosters/show.html.erb for a roster instance

Use dummy data so I can just approve the design

The table style and fonts need to be small and compact, headers should not be big

This is like a spreadsheet more than a webpage

Mousing over rows should be lightly highlighted
