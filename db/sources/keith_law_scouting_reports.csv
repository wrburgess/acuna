A 2022 second-round pick, Anthony changed his setup that offseason, freeing up his hands to loosen his whole swing through contact while also getting his hips and legs more involved to help him hit the ball harder, and it paid off almost immediately. Since his early 2023 promotion to High A, heʼs hit .294/.405/.521 across three levels, ﬁnishing last season in Triple A with as many walks as strikeouts at that stop. His average exit velocity for Triple-A Worcester was 88 mph, although he did start to hit the ball on the ground more (52 percent) in that brief stint, not a major concern but something to watch as he gets so close to a promotion to the majors. Heʼs very disciplined for his age, chasing just 20 percent of the time in Triple A, with a whiff rate under 9 percent, picking up spin very well even at a level when he was facing guys whoʼd pitched in the majors. Anthony has mostly played center in the minors, but heʼs not very rangy and heʼs maybe an average runner, so heʼs much more likely to end up in a corner, supplanted in center by someone with plus range. Heʼs got a chance to be a 30-homer, high- average, high-OBP guy in right ﬁeld, maybe with plus defense there, which is a “best player in the league” proﬁle. https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6078454/2025/01/27/top-100-mlb-prospects-2025-keith-law/ 5/148 3/12/25, 9:23 PM Top 100 MLB prospects 2025: Keith Law’s rankings, with Roman Anthony at No. 1 - The Athletic Photo:AP Images MLB Teams • • • • • • BOSTON RED SOX OF"

From then on, he cooked, hitting .296/.351/.511 until a late-season promotion to Double A, so that on the whole he ended the year with an OBP 17 points above the Sally League average and a slugging percentage 78 points above it — all as the https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6078454/2025/01/27/top-100-mlb-prospects-2025-keith-law/ 6/148 3/12/25, 9:23 PM Top 100 MLB prospects 2025: Keith Law’s rankings, with Roman Anthony at No. 1 - The Athletic leagueʼs youngest regular.

Heʼs an excellent athlete with above-average speed and gets very high marks for his feel for the game, including his ability to make in-game and in- season adjustments. Heʼs got tremendous bat speed and already produces hard contact at a very high rate, so thereʼs every reason to hope he can be a 30-homer guy with a high average even if his strikeout rate remains in the 24-25 percent range. Walcott is a shortstop now, and not bad there, but heʼs extremely likely to outgrow the position — heʼs going to be larger than Carlos Correa or Corey Seager, two bigger guys who deﬁed expectations to remain at short. At worst, youʼve got a right ﬁelder who hits for average and power. He wonʼt even turn 19 until the ﬁrst week of March, so he has plenty of time to keep turning these immense physical gifts into baseball skills. I think heʼs underrated already, and heʼs my pick to be the No. 1 prospect a year from now. Photo:Getty Images TEXAS RANGERS SS 3B"

Signed for a $1.3 million bonus in January 2021, Basallo has a fantastic swing thatʼs short to the ball but hard enough to produce plus power already, with more to come as he matures. Heʼs shown excellent plate discipline so far, and has hit left-handed pitching extremely well throughout his career, avoiding the platoon concerns that bedevil so many left-handed hitting prospects. Even in a tough debut in Triple A, where he really struggled to adjust to changeups, he still topped 110 mph (off a lefty!) and averaged 91 mph across all balls he put into play. Heʼs got at least a 70 arm and is athletic enough to become a 55 receiver and blocker, although right now heʼs succeeding more on his pure physical ability and needs more polish on the ﬁner points of catching. Basallo will probably be ready for a big-league role by the end of 2025, which will present a big dilemma for the Orioles, as theyʼre one of the only teams in baseball for whom he wouldnʼt be a huge upgrade behind the plate — and if Rutschman is “just” a 3-4 WAR player, as heʼs been the last two years, Iʼm not so sure that heʼs the better option. https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6078454/2025/01/27/top-100-mlb-prospects-2025-keith-law/ 8/148 3/12/25, 9:23 PM Top 100 MLB prospects 2025: Keith Law’s rankings, with Roman Anthony at No. 1 - The Athletic Photo:AP Images MLB Teams • • • • • • BALTIMORE ORIOLES C"

Heʼs mostly played center in the minors, but I still think heʼs heading to right ﬁeld between his size and just average speed so far. He also missed almost two months to start 2024 with a hamstring injury, so he hasnʼt played a full season yet.

The 22nd pick in 2023, Emerson went to Low A to start last year as an 18-year-old — his birthday is in late July — and hit .293/.440/.427 in 40 games, walking more than he struck out. The Mariners bumped him up to High A in early August, and he hit .225/.331/.317 in 29 games there — but still made plenty of contact — and then hit .370/.436/.537 as one of the youngest players in the Arizona Fall League. The bad news is that he played a total of 83 games between the regular season and the AFL, hitting the IL in April with an oblique strain, breaking a bone in his foot by fouling a ball off it in mid-May, and then leaving Arizona in early November after straining a hamstring. Heʼs played about 80 percent of his pro innings at shortstop and has shown the range and instincts to stay there, even though heʼs just an average runner; if his propensity to get hurt continues as he matures, he may be better served moving to third or second, but he's so much more valuable at short that heʼll probably stay there at least through the high minors. He has all of the ingredients to be a hitter for a high average and OBP, with a short path to the ball, excellent bat speed and a strong approach for his age.

His pitch recognition and selection remain very strong — he whiffed just 8.1 percent of the time he swung in Low A, and chased just 22.6 percent of the time, per Statcast data from that level — and he topped out at 106 mph in exit velocity, but he hit the ball on the ground a ton, as he can get too ﬁrm on the front side and ends up on top of the ball too often. Heʼs a true center ﬁelder who was a 55 runner last year, down from 70 speed in high school, and showed just an average arm, all of which was also a bit down from high school, possibly just the result of a much longer season and more frequent play than heʼd experienced before as an amateur in Indiana. His ﬂoor is a regular in center with high on-base percentages and plus defense; his ceiling, if the Tigers help him regain some speed and get him to loosen up his front side to drive the ball more, is a 25-homer/40-steal on-base machine.

It was a solid performance, boosted by above-average defense in center ﬁeld, but heʼs not just any prospect — he won the 2023 Golden Spikes award after starring at LSU and beating up on SEC pitching for three years. The good news is that his batted-ball data points to better results going forward, as he ran into some bad luck in the majors despite hitting the ball pretty hard in a small sample; his hard-hit rates in Triple A (43.3 percent) and the majors (44.7 percent) were both above the median, even though he was just 22 and young for both levels. Heʼs closed off some of the trouble he had in 2023 with fastballs up in the zone, and missed just 10 percent of the fastballs he swung at in the majors. He hit lefties ﬁne in his brief sample in the big leagues as well, struggling mostly against breaking stuff from righties, especially down and away.

Williams is a plus defender at short with an easy plus arm. He has 70 speed and shows above-average to plus power, hitting 20 homers for the second year in a row. He doesnʼt chase pitches out of the zone much at all — his chase rate last year was 22 percent according to Synergy Sports, which puts him well below the overall MLB rate, but when he does chase, he nearly always whiffs, and he also misses pitches in the zone more than youʼd like. Itʼs a decision issue rather than a mechanical one, but Williams performs so well in spite of the whiffs that changing his approach risks taking away some of the production as well. His 2024 season may also undersell his abilities, as he was hit on the hand by a pitch in June, missed just six days, and wasnʼt the same hitter afterward. He was hitting .294/.376/.552 with a 27.1 percent strikeout rate at the time of the injury, then hit .220/.324/.382 with a 29.4 percent strikeout rate after his return, which makes me suspect he was more hurt than he let on and just played through it. At worst, heʼs a shortstop with plus power, defense, and baserunning value who might just hit for a lower average because of the strikeouts. Thatʼs a 4-WAR player in a full season because of the value of the position, and I wouldnʼt rule out him getting beyond that with even tiny adjustments to his swing choices.

The Red Sox took him in the fourth round in 2023 as a redshirt freshman at Georgia Tech, betting on the makeup and the athleticism, and that good scouting work paid off as he not only hit at every level but did so while playing four positions — second, short, third, and center. Heʼs a plus runner whoʼs fast enough to play any of those spots, but his fringy arm probably limits him to second or center, with second his best position right now and in the long run as well. His swing has a little funk to it and he can get ﬂat through contact, resulting in a 60 percent groundball rate in his brief time in Triple A, but he has an incredible eye at the plate and gets the bat to the ball consistently enough for hard contact. He does have some holes heʼll have to work on, including four-seamers up and anything moving down and in under his hands or at his front hip, some of which may just be a function of his limited experience before getting to Triple A. Heʼs also already gained 10-15 pounds of further muscle this winter, which could help with bat control and getting some more loft through contact. He could easily be a plus defender at second and at worst should post high OBPs with 20-30 steals and 50+ extra-base hits a year. https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6078454/2025/01/27/top-100-mlb-prospects-2025-keith-law/ 17/148 3/12/25, 9:23 PM Top 100 MLB prospects 2025: Keith Law’s rankings, with Roman Anthony at No. 1 - The Athletic Photo:AP Images MLB Teams • • • • • • BOSTON RED SOX 2B OF"

His swing is pretty short to the ball, with good follow-through thatʼs on a lower plane for line drives, and his wrists are so strong that heʼs going to at least get to a high doubles total and probably still hit 15-20 homers at his peak. He didnʼt run much last year but has plus speed and good instincts on the bases, all of which could also help him if he ends up moving to center ﬁeld in deference to a plus defender at shortstop. If left at the position, he could be a 50/55 defender, thanks to some strong work by Arizonaʼs player development crew. I did note some concerns about him lunging out of his swing in 2023, but thatʼs all on the back burner now as we wait to see the healthy version of him return this spring training.

Heʼs also got a sweeper-slider and a hard slider, both of which are more weapons against righties, although the sweeper is probably going to be the fourth pitch in his arsenal in the majors. He has cleaned up his delivery somewhat since 2023, so he should be better positioned to repeat it and throw both more strikes and better strikes going forward, as high walk rates have been one of the only negatives on his report to date — he walked 12.6 percent of batters he faced in Double A and Triple A last year, which is a giant gift to batters given how hard his stuff is to hit. Heʼs also had a lot of non-arm injuries, missing the ﬁrst half of 2023 with a lower back injury and two months of 2024 with a hamstring strain, so heʼs thrown just 252 2/3 total innings in three full pro seasons, including time in the AFL in 2023. That may point to a limited workload in 2025, especially since heʼs likely to spend most or all of it in the majors.

Mitchell High School north of Clearwater that ended for him in early March when he broke a hamate bone. Between the injury and the fact that he was 19 at the draft, he slid down some teamsʼ draft boards, which was the Philliesʼ windfall when they selected him with the 27th pick, as heʼs quickly become their best position-player prospect. Last season, he ripped through Low-A Clearwater with a .275/.401/.483 line in 39 games where he topped out at 108 mph, then started slow in High A before taking off in his last month and a half there, ending up with a .258/.353/.444 line before a ﬁnal-week promotion to Double A, all very impressive for a player in his ﬁrst full year in the minors. He has exclusively played shortstop since he signed, and contrary to predraft reports, heʼs played it really well, to the point where no one seems to question whether he can stay at the position. Heʼs got very good instincts and shows above-average range in both directions, with a plus arm, playing defense like he wants to make every play. I saw him right after the promotion to High A and noted an overly aggressive approach and tendency to get on top of the ball; within about two weeks, heʼd already adjusted and was seeing more pitches and driving the ball again. Heʼs even a plus runner now who stole 23 bases in 28 attempts last year, likely adding even more value to his game. Miller has played just 122 games in pro ball, and wonʼt turn 21 until June, so heʼs still got time on his side and I think more power to come. With Trea Turnerʼs defense slipping — his Runs Above Average on defense hasnʼt been positive since 2021 — Miller might be the Philliesʼ future at shortstop, and sooner than you think.

Shaw started 2024 in Double A, where he overcame some bad luck on balls in play to hit .279/.373/.468 with just a 17.5 percent strikeout rate, and then bumped up to Triple A and hit .298/.395/.534 with a 19.7 percent strikeout rate. He makes very consistent hard contact, averaging 89.3 mph in Triple A with a 90th percentile exit velocity of 106. He utilizes a very rotational and clean swing that tends to put the ball in the air. Heʼs a shortstop by trade but has played second and third as well in the minors, a reﬂection of the Cubsʼ needs, with second base probably his best position and his third- base defense playable if not quite average yet. Heʼs a 55 runner with excellent instincts and could probably handle center or left if needed. Shaw is one of the best bets to hit for a high average of any prospect in the minors, and should add another half-grade of power to get last yearʼs 21 homers up into the 25-30 homer range in his best years. Depending on his position and how much he can improve his defense, he could be a 5-WAR player at his peak.

Heʼs supposedly on track to be ready for spring training, so in theory heʼs still just as good of a prospect as he was a year ago, with his throwing probably the biggest question, although the loss of a year of at-bats also hurts just about any prospect this side of Chipper Jones.

He had shown a tendency to swing too hard, mitigating it so far because he has strong hands and wrists to control the bat through the zone. Heʼll have to shake off the rust from the layoff, and then can resume working on recognizing changeups from lefties and spin from righties, both of which were vulnerabilities for him in 2023. Assuming his arm is OK — it was probably a 70 on pure arm strength, so he has some wiggle room — and the surgery hasnʼt adversely affected his swing, he still projects as a star whoʼs a plus defender and a very strong hitter for the position.

Rushing has shown excellent zone awareness since his debut, with a chase rate of just 21 percent across both levels last year, and his hard-hit rate in Triple A was 44 percent, comparable to Alec Bohm and Kyle Tucker in the big leagues. He can overstride a little and get off balance, especially given how hard he swings, but when itʼs all synced up his swing is geared to produce hard contact in that ideal zone of angles off the bat for power. Heʼs a solid receiver who threw out 30 percent of runners last year, and might be underrated as a defender because heʼs such a good hitter (something baseball fans who were online in the 1990s might know as Nicholsʼ Law of Catcher Defense — a catcher's defensive reputation is inversely proportional to their offensive abilities). The Dodgers just gave Will Smith a mammoth contract, but heʼs also been banged up quite a bit the last two years, so Rushingʼs imminent arrival in the majors might be right on time. If heʼs even a .340 OBP, 20-homer guy, which seems reasonable given his production and underlying data from 2024, that would make him one of the most valuable catchers in baseball. https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6078454/2025/01/27/top-100-mlb-prospects-2025-keith-law/ 27/148 3/12/25, 9:23 PM Top 100 MLB prospects 2025: Keith Law’s rankings, with Roman Anthony at No. 1 - The Athletic Photo:AP Images MLB Teams • • • • • • LOS ANGELES DODGERS C"

Mayo spent most of 2024 in Triple A, hitting .287/.364/.562 there with 22 homers in just 89 games around an IL stint (he broke a rib trying to catch a foul ball). His batted- ball data from that level was just as impressive — his exit velocity topped out at 114.9 mph, his 90th percentile EV was 107.2 mph, and his hard-hit rate was 41 percent, all of which would be above the major-league medians for those ﬁgures. His Barrel rate was over 12 percent, which would have ranked in the top 50 had he done it in the big leagues. He's 6-5 and does have long levers so his swing can get big, some of which is the natural tradeoff for the kind of power he displays, but may also point to a longer adjustment period in the majors as pitchers exploit that length. He hasnʼt swung and missed excessively in the minors, however, and he has made small adjustments to his approach and his mechanics as heʼs moved up, so thereʼs every reason to think heʼll do so in the majors. Heʼs played third and ﬁrst in pro ball and has made himself into a capable defender at the hot corner, but ﬁrst base will always be the easiest option — or possibly right ﬁeld, as he has plenty of arm and moves well enough for a corner outﬁeld spot. His bat looks like itʼll play anywhere, with 30-35 homer upside and a good enough plan at the plate to eventually get to league-average or better OBPs. Photo:Getty Images BALTIMORE ORIOLES 3B"

The former quarterback-shortstop-pitcher is now exclusively on the mound, and 2024 was a big step forward for him, as he moved through Double A to Triple A and cut his walk rate from 10.9 percent in 2023 to 8.6 percent across all of last year. Chandler has one of the best four-seamers in the minors, 94-99 with exceptional shape and life, giving it the illusion of rise, and hitters just canʼt do anything with it: Triple-A batters whiffed on it 27 percent of the time they swung, and when they did hit it they were more likely to go the other way because they couldnʼt pull it. Heʼs mostly fastball-slider-changeup now, barely using the curveball, so he can focus on improving just one breaking ball. Itʼll probably always be his third-best pitch, but it was effective against righties last year, and his changeup is still a plus pitch for him that he can use against both sides. The Pirates let him work a little deeper into games in 2024 and he showed no loss of stuff, while this was the second year in a row that he pitched a full season, so he should be ready to step into the big-league rotation by midyear. He only became a full-time pitcher in 2023, so he may still have more growth ahead of him on the mound than the typical 22-year-old, and heʼs every bit the athlete youʼd expect from someone who was committed to Clemson for two sports.

Heʼll sit 93-96 as a starter, with high spin rates but not a ton of life to it, a plus-plus slider as his out pitch, along with a high- spin curveball and perhaps too-ﬁrm changeup, although so far heʼs had no issues with platoon splits. Heʼs going to earn comparisons to Chris Sale as another lanky low-slot lefty, but heʼs a different animal; he might never miss bats at the same rate, but will generate a lot of weak contact and keep the ball in the park instead.

In 47 games total across four levels, he hit .280/.459/.567 with a 24.4 percent walk rate and 29.7 percent strikeout rate, hitting nine homers in that span, or roughly a 31-homer pace. He injured his right thumb while stealing a base in April, tried to come back and play through it, but reinjured it in September and ended up having a “cleanup procedure” on it after the season. He makes extremely hard contact when heʼs healthy, though. Even in his brief time in Triple A, he put 13 balls in play, peaking at 114.6 mph and averaging 90.1. And his knowledge of the strike zone is real; he even brought his chase rate down from about 14 percent last year to 11 percent this year and just 8 percent in his brief time in Triple A. Rodriguez calmed down his leg kick a little bit last year, although it doesnʼt seem to have made much difference in his results, and he still probably needs to swing more often at pitches in the zone. If he stays in centerﬁeld, with this power and patience he could be a better Mike Cameron (46.7 career WAR, so donʼt scoff). Itʼs more likely Rodriguez ends up in right ﬁeld, where his unusual proﬁle as a hitter will still make him an above-average regular, and thereʼs the potential for more if he gets a little more aggressive at the plate — and can stay on the ﬁeld for a full season. https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6078454/2025/01/27/top-100-mlb-prospects-2025-keith-law/ 34/148 3/12/25, 9:23 PM Top 100 MLB prospects 2025: Keith Law’s rankings, with Roman Anthony at No. 1 - The Athletic Photo:AP Images MLB Teams • • • • • • MINNESOTA TWINS OF"

(It helps that the current draft bonus system wildly undervalues the best players.) His 2024 was bookended by injuries, but after recovering from a hamstring strain, he hit .326/.407/.470 in his 60-game stint in Low A, then got off to a solid start in High A before he broke the hamate bone in his right hand, ending his season. The middle inﬁelder from a small private school outside of Philadelphia has a very clean, simple swing with good hip rotation to drive the ball to the gaps, and the excellent ball-strike recognition he showed as an amateur has certainly carried over — he walked more than he struck out at Low A and at High A, with 11 walks and just four strikeouts in 14 games at the latter stop. Heʼs played short and second in pro ball but doesnʼt have the range or quickness for shortstop, proﬁling much better at second and perhaps ending up a 55 defender there. If thereʼs a knock on his game, itʼs that heʼs not as projectable physically as most of the guys ahead of him on this list; he makes plenty of hard contact now, but thereʼs not much room on his 5-10-ish frame to get stronger, so any further power gains (he had ﬁve homers in 74 games, although the Florida State League is bad for power hitters) will have to come from swing tweaks.

Heʼs a very polished WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) player, offering little in the way of physical projection but also earning plaudits everywhere for his acumen for the game, leading evaluators to believe he will be able to make adjustments as he faces better pitching. He has an odd start to his swing with the bat back behind his rear shoulder and pointing down, but heʼs ready when it matters and has a short path to the ball once his hands get started. He showed incredible plate discipline in college and most of that carried over into the minors, as he still didnʼt chase much (22 percent) and only struggled against sliders in that brief stint, particularly left on left.

He was Atlantaʼs third-round pick in 2022 out of Missouri State, where he wasnʼt a full-time player until his draft year, and heʼs improved substantially as a hitter since entering pro ball, loosening up at the plate to try to get to more of that plus power. He had a slow start in Double A but Atlanta promoted him to Gwinnett in early June, after which he took off, hitting .298/.407/.484 at the higher level with 12 homers in 72 games. He hits the ball extremely hard — his average exit velocity in Triple A was 92 mph, his EV50 was 103, and his 90th percentile EV was 107 — so thereʼs every reason to think the power is real.

Heʼs a strong athlete and has the arm and hands to be a plus defender, ﬂashing that range at times but needing to be more consistent on routine plays. He murders fastballs, with the bat speed to catch up to top-end velocity, while offspeed stuff gave him more trouble than ever in 2024. It may be mechanical, as heʼs locking his front knee very early and trying to hit with a completely ﬁrm front side, leaving him vulnerable to stuff down at or below his knees; if thatʼs the issue, itʼs also ﬁxable, and he hasnʼt always hit this way. More concerning is that Mayer has yet to play in 100 games in a pro season, topping out at 91 in 2022, missing time due to a lumbar strain (2024), shoulder inﬂammation (2023), a sprained wrist (2022), and “back issues” (2022). Heʼs 22 now and still has superstar potential — a 30-homer shortstop with plus defense and what should be above-average OBPs is going to be the best player on his team in most cases. He has to show he can play 140 games in a year and get back to hitting offspeed stuff to be that kind of prospect again. Photo:Getty Images BOSTON RED SOX SS"

He performed well at the ﬁrst three stops as a 19-year-old in his ﬁrst full pro season. He was a two-way player in high school who had arm strength as a pitcher but no breaking ball to speak of, so while the Giants sort of said heʼd continue to pitch when they drafted him, everyone wised up and told him to go hit. Heʼs 6-7 but has a short swing for someone that size, one thatʼs far more geared towards contact than the kind of big-ﬂy, loft-oriented swing you might expect from such a tall hitter, and he kept his strikeout rate to just 25 percent until he got to Triple A, which is always the biggest concern with any hitter his height (or taller). He looks like heʼll be a huge power hitter, but while he makes hard contact, Iʼm expecting higher averages and doubles totals but a more modest home run output in the 20-25 homer range. He has played some right ﬁeld but itʼs apparently an Eldridge horror show out there, so ﬁrst base it will be. He still has work to do there, but thereʼs really nothing stopping him from becoming at least a 55 defender at the position, and he does give ﬁelders a big target for their throws.

He struggled in seven starts there, allowing 36 hits, including seven homers, in just 28 innings, as his fringy command came back to bite him, with too many fastballs left about belt-high and more experienced hitters better able to pick up some of his offspeed stuff. He works heavily off a four-seamer thatʼs been up to 99-100 and sits 96-97, while his best pitch is a slider thatʼs above-average to plus depending on the day; heʼll throw a decent change, a curve, and a two- seamer as well. Itʼll always be control over command, as heʼs so aggressive that itʼs hard to foresee him ever toning it down enough to be precise with his locations. Heʼll have to do a little bit of reﬁnement to make the last leap to the majors, as hitters will hit your stuff, no matter how good it is, if you put it on a tee for them.

He more than held his own, hitting .237/.361/.441 with a very respectable 23.3 percent strikeout rate that was slightly better than the Cal League average. He has a real knack for centering the ball and as he gets stronger his batting average is going to climb very quickly, since he already has the contact skills. He knows the strike zone extremely well for someone so young, and he rarely misses fastballs; he had more trouble with other pitch types, unsurprising given his complete lack of prior experience anywhere in pro ball, but didnʼt panic with two strikes and only swung and missed slightly more often in those spots. His regular season ended in mid-August when he strained his right shoulder on a diving play, but in a sign that the injury wasnʼt too serious, the Padres sent him to the Arizona Fall League, where he was, of course, the youngest player. He turned 18 in October, so heʼs younger than some high school players whoʼll be drafted on Day 1 this upcoming July. De Vries was already showing signs of adjustments when he got hurt, cutting his whiff and chase rates on various pitch types in the second half, and he has barely begun to grow into his 6-2 (actual height) frame.

Heʼs not very physical, but makes plenty of hard contact — his hard-hit rate in Low A after the draft was 55 percent, exactly the same as his hard-hit rate from the spring, and he topped out at 109 mph in Palm Beach — thanks to a short, efﬁcient swing that gets the most from his lower half (when his lower half is intact). He moved to shortstop from second and third as a junior, but of course never played it at full strength after the ﬁrst weekend, so while the safe bet is that he ends up at second base, he hasnʼt had a chance to show much at shortstop yet.

Heʼs limited to ﬁrst base — the horror — so he needs to hit, but so far heʼs hit everywhere, and itʼs especially promising that heʼs been swinging the bat more since he signed, as he walked a ton in college (78 times last spring) and could look passive at the plate. Heʼs up from swinging 33 percent of the time in college to 38 percent in the minors, and thatʼll probably increase a little more as pitchers realize just how good his ball/strike recognition is. When he does swing, he makes extremely hard contact; his 90th percentile exit velocity at Wake Forest was over 111 mph, and he continued to hit the ball hard in his brief time in the minors.

Liranzo started the year slowly for High-A Great Lakes, and was hitting .220/.344/.356 at the time of the deal, but then somewhat inexplicably took off with the change of scenery — he hit .315/.470/.562 in 26 games for the Tigersʼ afﬁliate in West Michigan, then went to the AFL and hit .375/.492/.667 in 15 more games, walking more than he struck out at both spots. Heʼs pretty mobile behind the plate and has a 70 arm, needing to work more on receiving to remain a full-time catcher. His bat is special — heʼs got a quiet, easy swing that still produces plus raw power because heʼs so strong to begin with, and his ball/strike recognition is excellent already. He had no trouble adjusting to offspeed stuff in the AFL, in contrast to much of the regular season where he ran into some difﬁculty with sliders and changeups. He was on the younger side for High A at age 20 and probably should spend all of this year in Double A to work on his catching and keep tightening up that pitch recognition.

His best pitch as an amateur was his changeup, which is hard to pick up out of his hand and has both fading and tumbling action to it, but it was actually less effective at generating whiffs than his 92-95 mph four-seamer or his high-spin slider in his six big-league starts, even just against lefties. All three of his pitches should be above-average, with the run helping the fastball play up and sharp downward break to the slider, so it was surprising that he gave up so much contact, with a 41 percent hard-hit rate, in his debut. Even with that high contact rate, Lowder was very lucky in the majors, with a 1.17 ERA but a 3.10 FIP, and even that latter ﬁgure doesnʼt adjust for the improbability of allowing 0 homers in 30 innings. Heʼs major- league ready and probably a league-average starter given his current velocity and what looks like 55 control and maybe 45 command, with of course the chance to get beyond that if he starts working less in the heart of the zone with his fastballs.

His follow-up in 2022 was marred by multiple injuries, including a nagging left wrist issue that interrupted his stint in the Arizona Fall League, and his 2023 fell somewhere in between, so it seemed like heʼd settled in as a future regular but one without much upside. He did nothing after returning to Double A to start 2024, but from the moment Boston promoted him to Triple A, he turned into Rogers Hornsby, hitting .333/.420/.498 even through a trade to the Pirates for Quinn Priester. Those numbers came with tons of hard contact: He peaked at 111 mph, half his balls in play were hard hit (95 mph+), and the average velocity of that upper half (his EV50) was 101.9 mph, all of which were comfortably above the MLB medians. His swing is very simple and direct; it doesnʼt have a ton of loft, so heʼs probably not going to be a big power guy (barring a swing change), and instead should run high BABIPs and averages, maybe challenging for the league lead in doubles. Heʼs a solid-average defender at second and his throwing has improved enough that heʼs not going to have any trouble staying there, although the left side of the inﬁeld is probably out of the question. My evaluations of Yorke have been all over the place since he was drafted, so take this with even more grains of salt than usual, but Iʼm buying Yorke now as a future 55, an above-average regular whoʼll have some years when he's an All-Star because he hits for such a high batting average.

He returned in 2024 and the Rangers kept moving him up as he kept posting, eventually getting him three starts in the majors in September where he looked as good as he had since his freshman year at Vanderbilt. He had lowered his arm slot back in 2022, but itʼs back to its original position, which allows him to get more depth on his slider. The slider is easily plus and might be a 70 once again, and keeps him on top of his 94-97 mph four-seamer. His path from here is largely about him — he has succeeded in the past by out-stufﬁng guys, and being very aggressive with those two main pitches (he has a curve and changeup, but uses them less), but in the big leagues heʼs going to have to show better command to get ahead of hitters and to avoid a lot of four-inning, 85-pitch starts.

His biggest area of improvement last year was using his strong ball/strike recognition to swing more — he swung at 39 percent of pitches he saw in 2023, then upped that to 47 percent last year, and, lo and behold, he hit better across the board, including boosting his slugging percentage against right-handed pitchers by 111 points.

He turned a lot of that on its head in spring training last year, showing up in incredible shape and with a clear determination to get better any way he could, and ended up pitching better after a midyear promotion to High A. White topped out at 97.6 mph in the Florida State League last year and sat 94-96 with his high-spin four-seamer, getting good ride at the top of the zone, along with an easily plus changeup and a slider that looked about average but played exceptionally well even at a relatively low velocity for the pitch (mostly 78-82). His delivery is pretty easy, perhaps still lacking deception — a concern scouts raised when he was an amateur — but it didnʼt affect him anywhere in A-ball and I wouldnʼt change anything right now. If he gets more power to the slider, which at least has above-average spin rates to work with, he could easily have three plus pitches, with a 200-inning starterʼs build and what now looks like at least average command. White did a great job preparing himself for the season last winter and the Marlins might have a future ace.

Heʼs every bit of a 70 runner and shows plus power already, and you can project 30/30 on him pretty easily if he continues to hit and control the zone as he moves up the ladder. He did have some more trouble with better pitching in the AFL, and the move up to High A and a worse hitterʼs environment this year will tell us more about just how advanced he is and how much time he might need to get to the majors.

He had played only 11 games above the complex leagues coming into 2024, then got hurt 28 games into the Florida State League season, missing three months with a strained PCL in his right knee. To make up for some of that lost time, he went to the Arizona Fall League, where he was one of the youngest players at 19 and one of a very small number of players there who hadnʼt played above Low A yet. In 25 games, he hit absolutely everything. Itʼs a hitterʼs environment out in the desert, sure, but his .433/.509/.867 line was good enough to lead the league in average and slugging. Heʼs a big guy, listed at 6-4, 200, and probably stronger than that, but his swing is very easy and quiet, and heʼs reached 109 mph in each of his two stints in Low A already, with an EV50 just over 100 mph. He also showed strong pitch recognition in the Florida State League and in Arizona, and rarely swung and missed; if thereʼs a knock on his offense, itʼs that heʼs a little too pull-heavy now, although heʼs also hardly had the need to try to do anything else. He only played ﬁrst base in Arizona with Thayron Liranzo there, and Briceño was already iffy as a catcher even before the knee injury. I think his future is at ﬁrst, and it might behoove the Tigers to just put him there now https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6078454/2025/01/27/top-100-mlb-prospects-2025-keith-law/ 88/148 3/12/25, 9:23 PM Top 100 MLB prospects 2025: Keith Law’s rankings, with Roman Anthony at No. 1 - The Athletic and let him go rake rather than slow his development or risk further injury at a position heʼs MLB Teams • • • • • • already unlikely to play.

As a pitcher, has been up to 99 and shows at least an average changeup, but itʼs a cross-body delivery with a lot of effort to it, resulting in well below average control (15.4 percent walk rate in two years for the Gators), and heʼs already had one Tommy John surgery in high school. The Royals have said so far that they intend to let him hit and pitch, which probably means heʼs going to stay at ﬁrst base to protect his arm; Iʼd love to see him just focus on hitting, given the 40-homer upside and the need for some big adjustments, which might also let him handle right ﬁeld.

He didnʼt hit well anywhere except for the one six-game series he spent in Triple A, still drawing plenty of walks but without any impact when he did make contact — which could easily be a result of the wrist injury. He went to the Fall League to pick up some more at-bats, and was a 45 defender at short there and running closer to average than plus, and might be better suited to second base regardless of the presence of Francisco Lindor at shortstop in Queens. Itʼs a compact swing combined with very good ball/strike awareness, and he could be a high-average/high-OBP second baseman with 55-60 defense, which would make him a solid or better regular. His 2024 season was just a lost year, and while he canʼt get those at-bats back, itʼs also possible that weʼll have to just disregard what he did do when he played because he wasnʼt 100 percent.

The Rangers took him in the ﬁfth round for the quality of his stuff — obviously not for the quality of his results — and told him to throw the splitter and go with a four-seamer up, and voila!, instant prospect! He works from the extreme third-base side of the rubber, getting some more deception against righties, as he has the splitter for lefties and can still be effective against them even without throwing offspeed stuff on the inner third to them. He has elite control already, pounding the strike zone with his fastball and walking just 3.7 percent of batters he faced at both levels of A-ball last year, although thatʼs likely to go up as older hitters lay off the splitter when itʼs out of the zone. He repeats his delivery to keep up the control, and while heʼs not very tall he looks strong enough to handle a starterʼs workload.

Montes is extremely strong and has produced exit velocities well north of 110 mph, with clear 40 homer upside as long as he hits enough to get to it. Heʼs not as natural of a hitter as Alvarez, although the Mariners worked with him on pitch selection and a two-strike approach last year and he did see better swing decisions overall. He raked in Low A as a 19-year-old, hitting .309/.411/.527 with just a 19.1 percent strikeout rate, then moved up to High A around the midpoint and hit .260/.378/.427 there with a 29.6 percent strikeout rate, still making hard contact but a lot more whiffs on stuff in the zone. Heʼs going to end up at ﬁrst base, as heʼs already really big for an outﬁeld corner and doesnʼt have much range, but thereʼs a pretty good chance he hits for enough power and takes enough walks to be an above-average regular there. I donʼt think Montes is really the next Yordan; he doesnʼt have the same kind of hit tool, but he also doesnʼt have Yordanʼs knees, which both required surgery when he was 23 and made him even less mobile than he was before.

A year and a half later, the project looks like a resounding success, as Ingle reached Double A last year, has walked more than heʼs struck out as a pro, and has improved his defense to the point where heʼs clearly going to stay at catcher. Ingle knows the strike zone extremely well, and he whiffed just 14 percent of the time he swung last year, with a short, quick swing that has a little more lift in its ﬁnish than it did in college, bringing his groundball rate down from 55 percent as a college junior to 45 percent last year. His defense isnʼt pretty but he can catch and block, and a quick transfer helps his fringy arm play up to the point where heʼs adequate against the running game. He hit 11 homers last year between High A and Double A, all off right-handed pitchers, and heʼll have to show he can make better quality contact against lefties, whereas now he just walks against them.

Jacksonʼs younger brother is also a centerﬁelder and an excellent athlete, a switch-hitter and centerﬁelder right now who could end up in a corner as he continues to ﬁll out and who may end up just hitting left-handed. Heʼs a strong defender right now up the middle with above-average speed, so if he can maintain that even with the physical projection he has left, he could remain in center in the long term. His plate discipline and hand-eye are outstanding, leading to chase and whiff rates well above (better than) average, although he needs to add some hand strength to get some more consistent loft in his ﬁnish.

Heʼs been much better from the left side; batting right-handed last year, he hit just .245/.409/.283, with more walks (16) than total bases (15). It might be a bat speed question, as his right-handed bat path looks ﬁne and he actually gets a little more loft than he does left-handed.

After three weeks there, he went to the complex league for a few games, then returned to Low A and hit .265/.331/.564 the rest of the way.

Heʼs a true shortstop with good actions and a plus arm, and the power he showed on the ﬁeld is legit, as heʼs got very strong hands and wrists, with a swing thatʼs very rotational and puts the ball in the air a ton — his groundball rate in Low A last year was just 31.4 percent. Heʼs still only 19 and remains projectable enough to end up a 30-homer bat in a few years; right now itʼs more consistently hard contact (his 90th percentile EV in Low A was 102.3 mph, and his EV50 was 99.0 mph on the dot) than huge top-end EV (peak was 107). Heʼs still a high-risk, high- reward player, as he continued to strike out 29.7 percent of the time in his second go-round in Low A, and generally needs to tighten up his pitch recognition and bring his chase rate (31 percent) down at least a little.

His approach is real — rather than that of someone who is up there to walk — and now he needs to get stronger to be able to do more when he does put the ball in play.

He got off to a great start as a 19-year-old in Low A, hitting .261/.371/.441 in the ﬁrst half, before wearing down in the second half. Heʼs a big, strong kid, but a better hitter than you might expect at ﬁrst glance, striking out just 20.1 percent of the time in Low A even as one of the youngest players in full-season ball, and he does make hard enough contact to project to 25 homers at his peak. He hits with a wide stance and no stride, just a toe-tap for timing, so he doesnʼt get all the power he could out of his lower half and his swing can ﬂatten out because he doesnʼt fully rotate his hips. The Guardians tried him in left ﬁeld last year as well as at ﬁrst base, and he was capable enough that theyʼll probably keep that alive as a possibility for him going forward. His future is in his bat, with contact skills and zone awareness that set him up very well for future success, and cleanup- hitter upside if he loosens up a little to drive the ball more easily.

As a sophomore at Tennessee, he had a wipeout slider, easily a grade 70, and may have been the best college pitcher in the country that spring, but that offseason he went to some sort of self-styled expert and switched to a sweeper that was ineffective — although it helped the Rockies get him at the ninth pick in the 2023 draft. His changeup has improved signiﬁcantly in the last two years to be a solid- average pitch, with a little wiggle at the end to help but mostly deceiving hitters from how he throws it. The slider is the key; when itʼs on, itʼs 85-87 with hard tilt and a big move away from right-handers. It can end up more cutter-like at 89-90, still effective but with a different shape that makes it look more like the fastball, and could even be his best approach to lefties rather than the changeup. The Rockies have already helped him get part of the way back to his 2022 form, and if they can get that slider to be more consistent, itʼll be a real out-pitch, and the weapon heʼll need given his just average command and control.

Heʼs got power, nearly getting to 20 homers as a teenager in Low A, and the Royals have helped loosen him up a little by reducing the very wide stance he used in high school to a more typical one that has him back in the box to start, giving him lots of room to stride forward and get his hips rotating. He showed excellent ball-strike recognition last year as well, and while he had some difﬁculty with offspeed stuff, heʼs laying off more of those pitches when theyʼre not strikes than he did before. He seemed to wear down by the summer; he hit .257/.391/.468 in the ﬁrst half, striking out too often (31.2 percent), then hit .195/.338/.372 from the All-Star break until a promotion to High A for the last two weeks of the season. Mitchell isnʼt much of a runner, at least not by the stopwatch, but heʼs improved his baserunning signiﬁcantly and stole 25 bags in 32 attempts. He has a cannon of an arm, with average to above-average receiving and blocking skills now that could end up plus. Mitchell has already made some big adjustments since he signed, which is the best harbinger of a playerʼs ability to make further adjustments.

Heʼs barely begun to ﬁll out but already makes hard, loud contact from both sides of the plate, getting compared to Jackson Chourio at the same age, but with better batted-ball data. Heʼs a shortstop now with a plus arm that will help him with a likely move to third base once heʼs a little older, and the Brewers have already given him time at third and second, so they may be thinking along the same lines.

He signed in January 2022 with the reputation of being an advanced hitter, and thatʼs been true, as he has a great approach that has him aggressive within the strike zone without expanding outside of it too often. Heʼs short with a stockier build, with really no chance to stay at shortstop, so there was more pressure on him to hit the ball harder, and he did so, with big improvements in his batted-ball data and his power output.

He sits more 93-96, with a slider that ranged from the upper 70s to the mid-80s with short but abrupt downward break, and a heavy split-change around 83-85, with both of the offspeed pitches missing a ton of bats this year. The arm is still kind of late relative to his front leg, and all the moving parts in the delivery make me suspect itʼll always be more control than command for him. He also doesnʼt seem to pitch down with his four-seamer at all, which might not be an issue but just strikes me as unusual. Sykora pitched like a future ace last year, and he has two pitches that could get him there. He may have simply out-stuffed Low-A hitters, however, and I would like to see him do it against more advanced hitters before buying in completely. Photo:Team USA Baseball WASHINGTON NATIONALS RHP"

No one doubts that he can play, though — itʼs potentially three plus tools in his hit, run, and ﬁeld grades, with an average-ish arm and below-average power.

Thereʼs deﬁnite bat speed here, enough to turn on good velocity, but there isnʼt average power now and he doesnʼt have the projection to get there. His best route to becoming a regular — or even an above-average one — is to be a high-OBP, high-contact hitter who steals bases and plays plus defense in center, even with six-to-eight homers a year. Heʼs not the next Corbin Carroll, another undersized outﬁelder who the Dbacks selected and developed into a superstar, but he could move quickly through A-ball if his plate discipline is really as good as advertised.

Itʼs the worst-looking swing on this list. Iʼm not even sure whoʼs second. But DeLauter has also had success everywhere heʼs played so far in the minors, and the biggest knock on him right now isnʼt the fact that looking directly at his swing will turn you to stone, but that he hasnʼt been able to stay on the ﬁeld for a full season. Since the Guardians took him with the No. 16 pick in 2022, at which point he was already out with a broken bone in his left foot, DeLauter has played in just 96 regular-season games, plus two stints in the AFL. The original fracture cost him the remainder of 2022. He required surgery in that winter after he re-fractured it, then suffered another fracture in that foot in April 2024, then developed turf toe in his ﬁrst game back from that injury. He strained his hamstring in late August and missed another month. On the plus side, heʼs hit very well when heʼs been able to play. He destroyed A-ball pitching, hit .271/.353/.436 in 36 games in Double A across two years, and went 7-for-23 with two homers in Triple A this year, followed by his second straight year of excellent production in the AFL.

Heʼs going to have to make some adjustments to get him on time to the zone more consistently, and I think major-league pitchers are going to attack that front hip with velocity up and in, which he can only hit on the ground, and then go soft away to exploit the swing. Nobody has really done that effectively so far in his career, however, so maybe heʼs just good enough to work around them and use his high contact skills to force pitchers to pitch to his strengths — Dustin Pedroia did something similar, and he had a very unorthodox swing as well. DeLauterʼs also a 55 runner and might be a plus defender in a corner, although I think his propensity to get hurt probably makes centerﬁeld a non-starter. Photo:Getty Images CLEVELAND GUARDIANS OF"

Heʼs just way too aggressive at the plate, chasing offspeed stuff out of the zone at a rate thatʼs not going to be sustainable for a major-league regular — which is why the loss of a year- plus of plate appearances was so damaging for him, as he needs to work on ball/strike and pitch recognition, and the best way to do that is by playing. Iʼve said before he reminds me a ton of Alfonso Soriano, who had similarly electric wrists, never ﬁgured out shortstop, and wasnʼt anything close to “patient” at the plate, but improved his approach enough to hit 412 homers and play 16 years in the majors.

Heʼd touched triple digits in high school with high spin rates on his fastball and two breaking balls, but in his ﬁrst outing in the regular season last year he was just 90-93, building up to 93-97 in his ﬁnal outing in Low A on May 25. Heʼs got a very long arm swing and his arm can be a little late, despite which he still shows a plus slider that generated a 41 percent whiff rate in Low A.

Heʼs working much more to his glove side now than he did in college, using the fastball and slider that way, since the slider is his only pitch with much horizontal movement, and he had no platoon split at all in High A last year. The knock on Hamm is that he didnʼt hold his velocity all season, and he got hit a little more as the fastball velo declined over the course of the summer. It was his ﬁrst full pro season, and he only spent one spring as a full-time starter in college, so this was the most heʼd ever pitched without some kind of break or layoff, which is the only reason Iʼm willing to cut him some slack on the velo dip. If that happens again, heʼs probably a reliever, and has the weapons to be a good one. His spot on the top 100 is a bet that heʼll stay a starter with more experience and perhaps a little work with the Tigersʼ strength and conditioning team, ending up a solid No. 3 or more. If that doesnʼt work, he could be a bulk reliever given how many effective offspeed pitches he has, just working less than a starter to try to keep his velocity up.

Heʼs shown more in-game power the other way than to his pull side, and doesnʼt really try to turn on stuff on the inner third yet. His ball/strike recognition turned out to be much more advanced than expected, and the fact that he came back as well as he did from a 2023 season that was ruined by multiple injuries and some visible uncertainty at the plate is a positive sign.

The bar to be an everyday catcher in the majors is so low, however, that even if Mack ends up a .290 OBP guy with 20 homers and 55 defense, heʼd be a very good regular, and thatʼs well within his reach.

It required surgery and ended his season. He continues to show a very advanced approach, recognizing all pitch types and commanding the strike zone, and has tweaked his swing since he ﬁrst signed to hit far more line drives and fewer groundballs. He had a 27.8 percent line-drive rate in 2024, which would have ranked third in the Midwest League if heʼd qualiﬁed, and he makes hard contact, just without enough loft or huge exit velocities to put the ball in the seats. Itʼs a short path to the ball with some lift to it, but with more doubles power that puts a lot of line drives into the gaps. I donʼt think heʼs got the projection left to end up a 20-homer guy, but he has a reputation as both a hard worker and a guy who likes to work out, so I wouldnʼt say itʼs impossible. Heʼs a fringy defender at third and played some second as well in 2024, probably a 45 defender at either spot, with ﬁrst base the default option if he canʼt stay elsewhere on the dirt. The worst-case scenario is heʼs a 10- homer ﬁrst baseman with above-average OBPs, a regular on some teams but not all; the best- case one is where he sticks at third, gets stronger for 20+ homers, and has OBPs close to .400 … which would probably make him an MVP candidate, now that I spell it out. https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6078454/2025/01/27/top-100-mlb-prospects-2025-keith-law/ 145/148 3/12/25, 9:23 PM Top 100 MLB prospects 2025: Keith Law’s rankings, with Roman Anthony at No. 1 - The Athletic Photo:AP Images MLB Teams • • • • • • CINCINNATI REDS 3B 2B Additional top prospect coverage GO DEEPER MLB prospects who just missed Keith Law’s top 100 ranking: Caissie, Saggese and more GO DEEPER MLB 2025 farm system rankings: Keith Law ranks all 30 teams, Mariners are new No. 1 GO DEEPER A list of every MLB team’s top 20 prospects for 2025 by division (Top photo illustration by Demetrius Robinson / The Athletic; Photos from left to right — Jackson Jobe, Samuel Basallo, Roman Anthony, Sebastian Walcott: Tim Warner, Christopher Pasatieri / Getty Images; Brace Hemmelgarn / Minnesota Twins / Getty Images; Chris Bernacchi / Diamond Images via Getty Images) What did you think of this story?
