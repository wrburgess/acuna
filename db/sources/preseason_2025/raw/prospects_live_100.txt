Scouting Report

Roki Sasaki was the number one pick in the 2019 Nippon Professional Baseball draft by the Chibba Latte Marines. While in high school he was clocked at 101 off the mound, and he had a heavy workload so Chibbe took it easy with him and he didn’t pitch a full, unrestricted season until 2022. He finished second in the league in strikeouts that season and he also had a 19 strikeout perfect game as a 20 year old. Prior to the 2023 season he was on the national stage as he pitched during the World Baseball Classic and performed well. Injuries limited him to just 33 starts in 2023 and 2024 combined, and in 2023 he missed time due to a torn oblique and in 2024 he battled with shoulder fatigue. Despite the injury riddled 2024 season he insisted to be posted and Chibba ultimately obliged. He didn’t have enough service time in Japan and also was still considered an international amateur due to his age so he was still subject to the bonus pools. The Dodgers unsurprisingly won the bidding for his services and signed him for $6.5 million and he is under team control for the next six seasons. Sasaki is one of the best pitchers in the world and brings a true 80-grade pitch in his splitter. The pitch sits around 88-91, although early spring training statcast data from his one professional outing had the pitch averaging 85, and it is a major whiff inducer. A true out pitch and he is able to cut it and uses it as an out-pitch against left-handers and also right-handers. His fastball sits 97-100 and is a plus-plus pitch in its own right. He has a tall, lean, athletic frame but despite the multitude of moving parts it is relatively easy and adds to the illusion of the fastball. It’s a sneaky pitch that just explodes on hitters. His slider is 83-85 and it just gives him another pitch to put hitters away with. It’s now a regular part of his repertoire and he will also mix in a big slow curveball to steal strikes. The only thing standing in his way is his health, and he has said it was recommended he receive Tommy John once already and he elected to pitch through it instead. Sasaki will be on the roster for the Dodgers and will need to be officially added to the 40-man prior to his first appearance. This is a special arm, a future top of the rotation type arm. - Matt Thompson

Scouting Report 

Roman Anthony, the crown jewel of the Red Sox 2022 draft, signed for nearly three times the slot amount, and his $2,500,000 signing bonus was the largest in the Sox draft class. Despite some early contact issues as an amateur, the Sox stuck with him and have been rewarded, as he’s in the conversation as the potential top prospect in all of the minor leagues. The offensive skills are loud, and the underlying data has always been strong, even as he’s developed a reputation for being a bit of a slow starter. He still managed to end the season in Triple-A and will debut sometime in early 2025. Anthony has plus in-game power with plus-plus raw, and he hits some absolute moonshots when he gets a hold of one to the pull side. His max EV sits around 116 for the 2024 season, and his 90% exit velocity is near the top of the leaderboards. His contact rates are slightly above average, and he does well in the zone. He makes sound swing decisions and will work a walk as well. Defensively, he’s capable of playing all three outfield positions and would be an asset in an outfield corner. His above-average arm and speed make him an excellent fit for the problematic Fenway Park right field. Anthony leads this exciting young group of prospects that should all hit Fenway in 2025. - Matt Thompson

Scouting Report

You would be hard-pressed to find someone who raised his stock in 2024 higher than Campbell did this season. After an offseason of bat speed training, altering his swing path, and reportedly adding 15-20 pounds of muscle, Campbell dominated the minors and made it to AAA. He started the season hot off at High-A, and I was intrigued, but he far surpassed what anyone could have expected from him this season. It all starts with his above-average hit tool, which provides an excellent foundation for a solid big leaguer. He runs great contact numbers while featuring an advanced approach with little chase. A guy with this bit of pro ball experience flying through the minors and posting a 90% Z-Contact rate and only an 18.2 Whiff% is not regular. On top of that hit tool, he made huge strides in the power department, and the exit velocities jumped significantly this season. This is a guy with plus raw power, and he knows how to access it in the game already. The bat is advanced beyond his days, and it's easy to see it translate to the big leagues soon. His speed is also at least above average and might even be more than that right now, but if he keeps adding size, it could start to trend down eventually. Right now, however, it is yet another tool that should be an asset for him. Defensively, Campbell is a bit raw and still has work to do, but he should be an acceptable second baseman. He has the speed and arm to play the outfield, so hopefully, more reps allow him to develop there. Campbell has a big, physical frame features a rare hit/approach/power/speed combination that is hard to find. There is very little reason not to be all in on him, and the stock soaring is very well-deserved. - Grant Carver

Scouting Report

Jackson Jobe has made it to the majors, and given the landscape of what it is like to be a pitching prospect, this should be considered a slight win by the Tigers and Jackson Jobe. Jackson Jobe is on the shortlist of best pitching prospect in the entire game because of good command and outlier stuff. He releases the ball from a five foot 8 inches release point, and that allows all of his stuff to play up. He repeats his delivery well, and this, along with his stuff, has given him such a high floor. The fastball comfortably sits in the mid-90s, but as you saw in his brief major league stint when he is ramped up, the fastball can be revved up to 99. There is a chance he is hitting triple-digits in starts at some point in his career. His fastball plays up from his lower-release point with 12 inches of drop; it has the characteristics to play in the zone while also getting whiffs up and out. The slider is a hard mid-80s offering with plenty of sweep. It has a real putaway pitch against right-handed and left-handed batters; with nearly 30 inches of drop, the sweeper is a good late-in-count weapon for the young right-handed pitching prospect. The cutter offers plenty of weak contact because of its "bullet" shape and 28 inches of drop, causing batters to swing over the top of the ball and, in turn, inducing weak contact. It has a chance to be a real bat-misser with a few tweaks to his sequencing. The changeup is also a weapon, albeit not utilized as much as one would want in his brief stint in the majors. Jobe's big issue is that despite having stuff you would build in a pitching lab, he does not put away as many batters as you would want. The "problem" as currently constructed isn't the stuff because he has four 60s or better pitches, with above-average command of all of those pitches, but it is indeed a sequencing issue. He could stand to utilize his cutter later in counts to right-handed batters, which he started to do late in the season, and experiment with the changeup against left-handed batters to try and put them away. The stuff is crazy, and Jackson Jobe is healthy, but he will exhaust prospect eligibility by mid-season at the latest. We could do it if he can get his sequencing dialed in more. Jackson Jobe has a good rookie season in 2025 and would presumably be one of the favorites for the AL RoY award while being on the shortlist for the best prospect in baseball when we release our top 100 list. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

The Nationals handled Dylan Crews' first taste of the major leagues as well as they could have—he's just 21 at-bats away from prospect graduation. This not only sets them up for a potential PPI pick next year but also allows Crews to get his feet wet against some of the best pitchers in the world. He's widely regarded as one of the best prospects in the game, thanks to his five-tool skill set. As a dynamic athlete, Crews has the speed to challenge for infield hits on ground balls and to steal his fair share of bases. His speed also translates well to the outfield, where, while he's projected as a corner outfielder, his range and reads are both plus. In the batter's box, Crews initially showed a two-pronged issue at the major league level: he was overly passive but became more aggressive as he adjusted to major league pitching. Additionally, he tended to get on top of the ball, contributing to a higher-than-normal ground ball rate. However, these are small-sample issues, and Crews has shown enough barrel control to adjust and correct this tendency. He displays above-average plate coverage and can take pitches the other way, though it would be nice to see him lift and pull more consistently. For now, he's more of an all-fields hitter who works deep counts and capitalizes on mistakes. He doesn't whiff at an alarming rate, which only strengthens his profile. When Crews does pull the ball, he demonstrates plus power. Having already made his debut, Crews will likely graduate off prospect lists within the first week of 2025. He has been a plus big league regular for a very long time. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

Carson Williams has an incredible collection of tools, but his hit tool is a genuine concern. He’s a well-built athlete with the modern shortstop frame and room to fill out as he matures. One of the twitchiest athletes in the sport, Williams displays excellent lateral explosiveness, allowing him to reach batted balls and make plays to both his left and right. His defensive acumen at shortstop is impressive—he can make any play you’d want, with plus defensive range that will be valuable for the Rays, at least while he’s still arb-eligible. He also possesses a plus arm with a remarkable touch, consistently making accurate throws from any arm angle and providing valuable support for first base. Williams’ explosiveness translates to the basepaths, too. With his plus first step, some might call him a “jitterbug,” given the current state of the run game, he could easily steal 30 bases a season. His speed also allows him to score from second or go from first to third when needed. However, Williams’ hit tool is alarming—it borders on unplayable. The main issue is his swing, which gets too long and includes a hitch that makes it nearly impossible for him to handle velocity up in the zone. He’s also one of the more passive hitters in the minors, almost appearing disinterested in swinging the bat sometimes. His struggles with reading spin often lead to ugly, Javy Báez-esque swings on breaking balls away. Despite these issues, when he gets a pitch in the narrow zone where he can do damage, he has the loft and bat speed to hit 20-25 home runs, even with a below-average hit tool. Williams is a frustrating prospect. He could become one of the game’s better shortstops on a WAR basis, thanks to his elite defense, but he has little to no floor because of his swing decisions. The Báez comp fits him well—early in his career, he might get by with a below-average hit tool because of his power, glove, and baserunning. If he loses a step athletically as Báez did, the problem is that he could completely crater.- Rhys White

Scouting Report

Having only turned 18 years old and made it to Double-A in 2024, Sebastian Walcott is the buzziest name in all minor leagues. Sebastian Walcott is a twitched-up athlete with a general smoothness that he brings to the game of baseball. The pride of the Bahamian baseball scene is an easy plus-athlete with easy plus power projection and is a twitched-up athlete. It is so much so that if he grew up in the US, there is a chance we won't see him playing baseball as he is built like a prototypical receiver with long arms and a lean frame. He is lean but has good muscle all over his frame. The Rangers have deployed him at shortstop and third base. He is loose and, at times, reckless at shortstop, and this should be something that gets dialed in as he gets more pro experience. He takes unconventional routes to batted balls hit on the dirt and can sometimes be far too upright in his stance defensively. Again, he is 18 at the time of writing this, and there will be plenty of time to work on this. In the batter's box, Walcott has one of the highest ceilings of any prospect; he has crazy raw power and just might hit enough to tap into his power. His swing decisions are aggressive, and he wants to get out in front of fastballs, but this approach leads to some ugly swing-and-miss. A lot of his pitch recognition issues can be excused away because of his relative lack of experience, but not all of them. He is looking to go up to the plate and swing early and often, and this approach, mixed with some red flags about breaking ball recognition, muddies the water on his overall bat-to-ball skills. The quality of contact when he makes it, though, is exciting, routinely barreling up pitches with ease and with some natural loft in his swing, which, paired with his electric bat speed, allows him to generate pretty crazy raw power. He is also one of the smoothest athletes you will see, with easy plus speed. As he continues to fill out, he may ultimately move off shortstop but stay on the left side of the infield, where his plus arm is an asset. Walcott is one of the more high-risk, high-reward types out there and has the highest upside in baseball. - Rhys White

Bazzana terrorized opposing pitching across three electric campaigns at Oregon State, where he slashed .360/.497/.660 with 45 home runs. The Australian native wound up being the first player off the board, spearheading an absurd Guardians class that is rich with talent. While it’s a bit unorthodox to take a second baseman at 1.1, Bazzana was ultimately the safest pick that Cleveland could have made. Bazzana’s frame is filled out, but the toolset is robust, especially at the plate. It’s an unorthodox swing with a significant leg kick and some stiffness, but Bazzana’s bat explodes through the zone, and he has some of the best barrel feel amongst any 2024 prospect. Bazzana has strong swing decisions and draws an immense amount of walks; his contact skills are extremely robust. It’s an easy plus-hit tool with compactness and uber-quick hands. Bazzana posted plus exit velocities with metal in college, eclipsing the 110 MPH barrier on multiple occasions, though that will settle out to above-average in the minors. He possesses exceptional bat speed, and he’s added more loft to his swing as his power plays to both sides of the field. With that said, his power plays best to this pull-side. Bazzana is a plus runner with an athletic gait and strong run times. Defensively, Bazzana’s speed gives him suitable range for shortstop, though his arm strength is fringe-average and limits him to second base. He may be blocked in the middle infield, given Cleveland’s major league depth, meaning that he may get moved to the outfield to create a spot for him. His speed would translate well in center field if such a move occurs. - Tyler Jennings

Scouting Report

Basallo is a big, physically imposing player with long levers and some noticeable bulk, especially in his upper body. There's room for him to add more muscle, particularly in his lower half, as he fills out with age. His standout trait is his performance at the plate, where his offensive potential shines. Basallo employs a slight leg kick in his setup and generates impressive rotational force from his hips and lower half, leading to consistent hard contact. He shows the potential to become a 60-grade hitter at maturity, with a knack for barrel manipulation and adjusting his bat path to pitches in all areas of the strike zone. He makes solid swing decisions and occasionally passes up borderline pitches, showing discipline by not chasing out of the zone at concerning rates. Basallo has a well-rounded approach, driving pitches to the opposite field when away while pulling pitches in the zone with more loft in his swing. His ability to hit for both contact and power suggests a future as a middle-of-the-order bat, capable of driving the ball out of any part of the park. Defensively, Basallo currently catches, but he likely won't stick behind the plate in the majors due to his stiff and clunky movements. He lacks the fluidity needed for a big-league backstop. A move to first base is more likely, where his bat would more than carry the position. Given his plus arm strength, he could transition to a corner outfield spot. While not entirely on the level of Yordan Alvarez, Basallo could reach 80-90% of Yordan's offensive production, and at that level, his defensive home will only matter a little. His value will primarily be tied to his bat, and he has the potential to become a middle-of-the-order force. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

There might be no more buzzy name in the prospect streets than Jesus Made. Made has had a meteoric rise to being one of the best prospects in the game, and a lot of it stems from him being already polished as a hitter. He has a smooth swing from either side of the plate, with little discernible difference from either side of the plate. When you watch him, the big thing that stands out is his ability to lift and pull batted balls with authority. His swing is so optimized for someone his age that he shows an excellent feel for getting out in front of pitches on the inner half, but he also has more than enough bat speed to attack breaking pitches on the outer half to spoil them. Made for his age, he has impressive game power that could end up double-plus by the time he gets to the majors. Made’s swing decisions are impeccable, and when you factor in how young he is and how few professional reps he has, he could very well end up being a 70-hitter when he reaches the majors—in the field, Made projects out as a league average defender at a few different positions. He will still play shortstop and should continue working at the six because there are flashes of him being able to make the routine play, and he has more than enough lateral agility to play there. His reads are slightly less refined, but that should get better as he climbs through the minors. He could move to third or even center field very well because he has the foot-speed to play center field with some coaching and reps. There have always been hyped-up DSL prospects, but none have performed this well and hit every statistical and aesthetic benchmark that Made has. The question with Made is how aggressive one can be with projecting on him; he hasn’t seen a state-side pitch in the game and is already a top-10 prospect in the game. - Rhys White

El Mutante is one of the highest ceiling prospects in all the low minors, and at just 18 years old, LDV has already seen time in Single-A. The Padres are known to be unconventional with their prospects, and LDV skipping over the DSL and AZL a couple of months after signing fits the unconventional manner they like to follow, as they did with Ethan Salas. LDV is one of the most impressive athletes I have seen in the California League. He is an easy plus runner with good lateral agility, and that helps him in the field where he is more twitchy than refined at shortstop, but again, he was only 17 years old. If he grew up stateside, he would be a draft-eligible high school senior and would be the number 1 pick in the upcoming MLB draft. As a switch hitter, there is no discernable difference between his left-handed and right-handed swing and no difference in aesthetics or outcome. LDV makes solid contact, all things considered, and he has shown off some impressive power from both sides of the plate. There is well above-average bat speed and some natural loft in his swing that portends to more power coming, especially as he fills out. There is good strike-zone recognition for someone as young as he is, and there is a semblance of an approach; although he will chase breaking balls away, this can get cleaned up as this is more of a swing-decision issue than a pitch-recognition issue. There are some extreme outcomes for De Vries. He could end up being a 70 this time next year, or he could have some serious prospect fatigue like his organization mate Ethan Salas. If everything clicks, it’s a switch-hitting shortstop who is a legitimate 5-tool prospect. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

If he was healthy, Painter would be the top pitching prospect in all of the minor leagues, and the fact that he’s still very much in that conversation after missing all of 2023 and 2024 speaks volumes. He made five starts in Double-A as a 19-year-old and will likely make his big league debut at a still very young 22. When healthy, Painter has sat 94-99 and touched 100 with ride and life up in the zone. He’s able to hold that velocity throughout his starts. The slider is the best secondary in his arsenal, sitting more in the mid-80s while averaging nearly a foot of sweep and consistently being landed for strikes. The curveball is more of a 12/6 shape in the high-70s to low-80s with solid break and bite when he’s on. It’s mainly used to steal strikes. Finally, the changeup improved in 2022, with him becoming more confident on the pitch later in the season. It’s a high-80s pitch that touches 91 MPH with serious dive and garners quite a bit of swing and miss down in the zone. The pitch could be a plus later on. He also has excellent command of his entire arsenal, especially his fastball. Thanks to his plus extension, everything plays up, and he repeats his delivery extremely well and pumps strikes. He is the complete package when healthy and one of the few minor league arms with the ceiling of an ace with four above-average or better offerings and plus command. He returned to the mound in 2024 to pitch in the Arizona Fall League and was back to hitting triple digits and showing his excellent stuff and command. Painter is ready for the big leagues, but the primary question is how much he will be able to contribute in 2025 with a likely innings limit. - Matt Thompson

Scouting Report

The Cubs seem like they have gotten a star on their hands in Matt Shaw, and he could be the opening-day third-baseman for the Cubs as he is not only the best option there but is on the doorstep of making the major leagues. Matt Shaw is a smaller athlete but one of the twitchier players in the minors. He has easy-plus wheels and could very well be one of the league’s better stolen-base threats as soon as next year. He pairs that with a good feel for making contact, good balance, and quick hands through the zone. Matt Shaw shows a level of barrel malleability that isn’t common and could portend to more contact and even more power coming as he gets more reps against big-league pitching. Shaw shows a good feel for lifting, pulling, and getting out in front of pitches. He even shows a good feel for taking the ball the other way with authority. He has an unconventional gait when he runs, and that has led to some Isiah Pacheco comps in his running form, but he is twitchy and gets up to speed rather quickly. The Cubs may try him in the outfield at some point because he is a bit stretched at third base, but because of the Cubs roster construction, he has to play third. He should just be below-average there where he struggles with some reads and won’t ever make the highlight real play. Shaw has the chance to hit the middle of the Cubs lineup and be a power-speed threat they really need. The ultimate defensive home is in the air, but the bat has been ready since September. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

The Pirates have become one of the best organizations at developing arms, and turning Bubba Chandler into a full-time pitcher is a massive win because he has become among the best pitching prospects in the game. Bubba Chandler is one of the more athletic arms on the mound; his fastball explodes out of his hand. There aren't many moving parts to his delivery; he lifts his leg up and drives towards the mound. His has a lower release point, which helps the fastball "rise." His fastball plays well both up and out of the zone and in the zone where he dots the fastball to get whiffs all over. Hitters have a tough time with the fastball, and that sets up the offerings. You could argue that he doesn't utilize his fastball enough, but when you have three other above-average offerings themes, the breaks. The best secondary is a hard gyro slider with good velocity and shape. Right-handed batters especially struggle with it, and then he can mix in a slower, less tight curveball that plays well off the slider and fastball. The changeup is his primary secondary offering against opposite-handed batters, where its fade makes it challenging for left-handers to barrel up. The command can come and go during his starts, but for the most part, he spots all four of his pitches well all over the zone. Chandler could very well break camp with the Pirates, which is akin to what Jared Jones did last year, but Chandler is a much better version of Jared Jones with a similarly high-octane heater and better secondary stuff. Chandler could be the Pirates' number 3 starter and be a nice Rookie of the Year selection. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

The White Sox used the 26th overall pick on Noah Schultz as an Illinois prep, forgoing a commitment to Vanderbilt. The tall lefty utilizes a uniquely tall 6-foot-9 frame, throwing from a low three-quarters arm slot. He works exclusively from the stretch and is able to repeat his mechanics well. Schultz generally sits in the mid-90s with his fastball, which also has a two-seam variant. When he utilizes it in two-strike counts, he likes to climb the ladder. His slider is the crown jewel of his arsenal. It has a ton of movement across two planes. It’s a pitch he uses early and often against either-handed hitters, but he uses it almost exclusively against lefties. He’s not afraid to repeat the pitch several times in a row, if necessary, and it works. Against righties, he generally likes to backdoor the pitch but also will throw it to the backfoot. There is a changeup present also that can have an inconsistent release. When it’s located down in the zone, it flashes average with arm side fade. While Shultz can have a tendency to miss the arm side, he generally works around the edges of the strike zone. Even the pitches called balls usually don’t look too far off. He doesn’t walk many hitters and gets plenty of whiffs. Durability is a question, but talent is undoubtedly present. His slider is a signature offering that can generate lots of whiffs, but he sometimes tends to fall in love with the pitch. Between two plus or better pitches and above-average command, Schultz looks every bit the part of a front-end rotation arm.  -Trevor Hooth

Scouting Report

Possessing some of the best bat to ball skills in the minor leagues, Colt Emerson is an exciting blend of hit and power potential with up the middle skills on the dirt. Armed with a simple lefty swing, Emerson has more twitch in his hands than is typical for a hit over power guy, allowing him to post some intriguing EV numbers at a very young age. The power is yet to show up consistently in games, but the underlying numbers indicate it’s only a matter of time before he truly breaks out. Emerson was one of the younger players in the Arizona Fall League this past season and dominated the competition, showing off extra base power consistently. Emerson probably won’t win any awards at shortstop, however he’s competent enough to stick at the position thanks to some solid lateral movement and a good arm. He’s been able to steal bases at an above average clip since joining the professional ranks, however his top end speed doesn’t jump off the screen in film. It’s probably a hair above average at present, but might trend down if he adds some bulk down the line. An excellent clubhouse leader and diligent worker, Emerson brings a level of lighthearted intensity to a team that’s both invigorating for teammates and refreshing for fans. For a teenager that’s yet to crack High-A for more than a handful of games, Emerson remains a high floor prospect that possesses intriguing amounts of potential and could realistically be a middle of the order run producer at the shortstop position. Likely at least a few years away, he’s certainly a prominent name to follow closely. - Max Ellingsen

Scouting Report

Rodriguez is one of the most tantalizing prospects in baseball due to his unique combination of on-base ability, close-to top-of-the-scale bat speed, and raw power that offers a chance for him to be a middle-of-the-order bat. It's a thick, muscular frame with shorter levers that help him stay direct to the ball. Rodriguez has a quiet operation in the batter's box underpinned by a shoulder-height handset and a small stride as he swings. Explosive rotational acceleration is the foundation of close-to-the-top-of-the-scale exit velocities (with a max north of 117 mph and a 90th percentile exit velocity of 112.8 mph in a minuscule AAA sample). While Rodriguez's on-base ability is impressive (24.9 BB% in 2024), his approach flirts with the line between patience and passivity. His 31.9% Swing% would be dead last in MLB (although he's been getting more aggressive on pitches over the heart of the plate), and swing-and-miss issues led to a 29.4 K% in 2024. It's fair to question how much Rodriguez will hit at the MLB level. His 27.3 InZoneWhiff% was around 9% higher than average at AAA, albeit in a small sample, and he's shown vulnerability at the top of the strike zone. While he might not look the part, Rodriguez's defense is an underrated asset of his game. His above-average speed, efficient route running, and aptitude for controlling his body at the catch point all stand out, aided by a plus arm. As he ages and thickens, Rodriguez may lose the foot speed to man centerfield effectively, but the skill set should lend itself to a plus right field. Rodriguez remains a unique blend of offensive skills with the potential to be a middle-of-the-order bat if he can navigate contact concerns and hit just enough - Jamie Cameron

Scouting Report

The Dodgers drafted Will Smith years ago from Louisville, and he has become one of the game's premier catchers. In 2022, the Dodgers did it again when they drafted Dalton Rushing. Rushing has been moved slowly for a prospect, but a lot of that is because of the Dodgers and not his talent, plus a few injuries along the way. Rushing is a physically imposing athlete with enough beef to stay behind the dish. He is a decent blocker and has made strides as a receiver since I saw him in Single-A. He has an above-average arm, which has helped him, especially as the Dodgers have tried to find spots for him, like in a corner outfield. He looked solid in left field, and if that is his ultimate path to playing time in a loaded organization, he will more than hold his own there. With the bat, he has made impressive strides as a contact hitter, with improved plate coverage to go along with a slightly more selective approach that has unlocked what was already plus game power and has made it double-plus. He has a very pull-heavy approach, but that doesn't mean he won't go the other way. There is more than enough breaking ball recognition and strike-zone recognition here that as he faces the best breaking balls in the world, he has a feel for knowing which ones to spoil and which ones to turn and do damage with. When Rushing makes contact, it is loud contact, as it always feels like he is barreling up pitches; we project him to be a potential 30+ home run bat during his peak years. With the bumps and bruises that come with playing catcher, don't be surprised if Dalton Rushing catches a lot for the Dodgers going forward because having two quality catchers who are middle-of-the-order bats that can also go elsewhere and stay in the lineup is just so valuable. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

The Tigers took a chance on Max Clark third overall, which was met with some skepticism with Wyatt Langford still on the board. Clark has done nothing but outperform expectations since being drafted. An active member of social media, it isn’t hard to see how much work Clark puts into his craft. He is strong for his size, with some projection left. At the plate, he starts with his feet even, knees slightly bent, and hands up by his head. He utilizes a small leg kick load mechanism leading to a smooth, fluid swing. He’s very advanced at the plate for his age, showing excellent patience and zone recognition. Clark isn’t afraid to find himself in two-strike counts, where he can fight off pitches until he finds one he likes. That is showcased by the fact that he rarely chases pitches out of the zone. He has quick hands at the plate and does an excellent job adjusting to offspeed pitches. He does look to pull the ball more often than not, but he has shown the ability to use all fields. He can hit the ball very hard but takes a more line-drive approach. That may suppress his over-the-fence power, though he works the gaps well. Defensively, he takes excellent routes and takes reasonable first steps. He has more than enough speed to cover plenty of ground and pose a threat on the bases. With a boatload of tools, Clark must continue refining them. Clark has a hit-over-power profile right now with power that could wind up above average if he starts to lift the ball more consistently. In the long term, he has every skill necessary to be a successful table-setting center fielder who can get his share of All-Star nods. - Trevor Hooth

Scouting Report

Dollander’s operation is low effort and simple, ending with a 3/4 arm slot. He stands all the way on the first base side of the rubber. His upper-90’s fastball is clearly his best pitch in terms of both how it plays and his ability to command it. It plays well in the upper third. It explodes through the zone. When he throws his slider at the knees it has a lot of horizontal break with whiff potential. There is also a shorter, more cutterish version of the pitch when he throws it arm side. Dollander’s curveball is a distinct shape with excellent downward movement to it. He uses booth breaking balls evenly and both have the potential to generate swings and miss against right handed hitters. His changeup has good downward action to it, but he doesn’t use it as much. There is not a count where he won’t use either breaking ball or his fastball. He commands the ball well, walks aren’t a huge issue. On top of that his sequencing helps keep hitters off balance. Dollander has the makings of a pitcher who can sit atop the Rockies rotation. The fact that he plays for Colorado is less than ideal for this outcome as his arsenal may not play as well with the altitude. That being said, he has the skills to overcome his environment to be a top end pitcher. There shouldn’t be much, if any, more seasoning left before Dollander is major league ready. - Trevor Hooth

Scouting Report

The third time was the charm with Kumar Rocker, as he has been drafted three times; one time wasn't a serious selection when he was drafted out of high school, and then there was the whole Mets draft debacle with him. But we are past that, and Kumar Rocker is a big leaguer. There will always be injury concerns with him because, well, one, he is a pitcher, and two, there are so pretty serious injury flags in his past, and the greatest precursor to future injuries is past injuries. Kumar Rocker releases the ball in a pretty standard high three-quarters arm slot. Kumar Rocker is a physically imposing pitcher; this is a well-filled frame with a simple drop and drive to his delivery. Kumar Rocker is effectively a two-pitch pitcher, leaning on the two offerings' fastball, four-seamer, and sinker variations. The four-seamer has good velocity, but the shape is terrible, which gives it that "dead-zone shape," meaning it does not play well in the zone and gets struck when he throws it there. The sinker is better because of its natural arm-side run and sink. It gets whiffs at a solid rate, and towards the end of the year, the sinker was his preferred weapon. The slider is a real weapon against both-handed ness of hitters. He isn't afraid to have it cut in on the hands, which results in weak contact, and then he can use it to get whiffs. One of the issues with Kumar Rocker is a lack of a third pitch up until this point. He has been able to spam the fastball and slider, but a lack of a third offering brings some reliever risk into the equation. That, along with the injury track record, makes Kumar Rocker a scary proposition of a prospect, but the fastball-slider combo is good enough to play at the highest level. The potential here is a top-of-the-rotation starter, but there are enough workload red flags to make this upside smaller than it should be. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

JJ Wetherholt projects to have a lengthy big-league career as an above-average offensive second baseman. Wetherholt has a loose, open stance; his hands start at his shoulders and work their way up to head level in his simple load. He has a noticeable leg kick and stride that helps him time up pitchers. Wetherholt consistently produces competitive at-bats that come from his solid approach and good plate discipline, a testament to his advanced pitch recognition ability. He has a level swing that keeps his bat in the zone for a long time and has shown the ability to manipulate his bat path with good bat-to-ball skills, leading to few strikeouts. Wetherholt’s range is limited, and he will most likely not stick at shortstop due to his relatively below-average lateral quickness and average arm. Some of that is likely to be blamed on the hamstring injuries he suffered last year. Despite not being able to stick at shortstop, Wetherholt will undoubtedly have a spot in a big league lineup as a second baseman primarily because of his bat, but his smooth hands and solid instincts will allow him to be effective at the position; he probably won’t be a gold glover but he will get the job done at second and will be a consistent starter thanks to his aforementioned bat. It will be crucial for Wetherholt to maintain his hitting tools as he advances through the minor leagues. He will have to be cautious about protecting his hamstrings throughout the entirety of his career, given his prior injury history with them. Still, if he can do both of these, he will be an above-average big-league second baseman sooner rather than later. - Alex Kempton

Scouting Report

Kevin McGonigle has the potential to be an above average everyday regular second baseman in the future with his plus hit tool, to fulfill this potential he must continue to put together competitive at bats against advanced pitching and retain his defensive abilities. McGonigle has a medium sized frame with thick, muscular halves and broad shoulders; he is close to being maxed out and has little physical projection remaining. At the plate McGonigle has a slightly open stance, his hands start at ear level, his bat starts flat with a slight rock and he gets deep into his lower half pre-load. McGonigle utilizes a toe tap to time up pitchers and finishes closed, he has a simple load and stays short to the ball; he has solid bat speed and good plate discipline often drawing walks. His swing is level and adaptable, it is designed for contact but he still strikes balls well, his power is mostly gap to gap for now with the occasional HR, but when he connects with balls well he produces above average exit velocities; it’s very possible his power will continue to come along as his body finishes maturing. In the field he has fringy hands, average range, and an average arm; he will likely move off shortstop down the road due to his hands/range. He may be able to make the move to third base depending on how his defense continues to progress but he likely profiles as a second baseman in the long run due to his average arm. McGonigle is a pure hitter, he finds ways to get on base and doesn’t strike out often; he has the potential to be an above average everyday regular second baseman in the future and could even work his way into plus territory if his power continues to come along as he matures. -Alex Kempton

Scouting Report

Kurtz is massively built with a wide upper body and plenty of strength throughout his frame. Though not overly athletic, Kurtz has good body control and utilizes it to stay compact in his swing. Kurtz’s feet are slightly open in his stance, though his upper body is slightly closed. Kurtz sets his hands at head height and initiates his swing with a toe tap before subtly loading his upper half. The product is an ultra clean swing operation with few moving parts and borderline elite impact generation. Kurtz has double-plus raw power but gets to it so easily in game thanks to his simple downhill swing, keeping his raw and game power practically in line. Kurtz has a truly special tendency to strike the lower half of the baseball and backspin it with plus barrel accuracy. Kurtz does end up with his share of weakly hit or skied fly balls but he frequently puts hard contact on a line or in the barrel zone. 40 home runs are certainly in view for a player with Kurtz’s raw power and approach to hitting. As a hitter, Kurtz deploys double-plus discipline, dominating the strike zone and spitting on tough secondaries. Kurtz’s swing covers the entire zone and there are not many ways to attack a vulnerability. There is some swing and miss in Kurtz’s game with his in-zone whiff rate right about average, though some of that can be attributed to a power-geared swing. Kurtz has shown a true mastery for handling secondaries, rarely chasing them and finding ways to elevate breaking balls, an uncommon skill in pro baseball. Kurtz isn’t quite as good when it comes to offspeed pitches, getting deceived and off schedule occasionally but it is not a worrisome tendency as his production against offspeed pitches is still above average. Defensively, Kurtz has flashed plus hands and an ability to handle scorched ground balls but he can be over-reliant on his hands at times. There is plus upside defensively and a chance to be one of the game’s best defensive first basemen. Kurtz has an impressive arm for first base and it has been on display making tight throws back to the plate in squeeze situations or similar types of plays. Kurtz won’t make an impact as a baserunner and he may eventually become a well below average runner. Kurtz has the potential to be a premier first baseman and one of the game’s best hitters thanks to some uncanny hitting characteristics and double-plus pop. There’s limited risk in the profile here with his ceiling only capped by defensive limitations. - Tyler Paddor

Scouting Report

Mayo is built like your prototypical middle-of-the-lineup hitter with a filled-out frame and strength throughout. His strength is in offense, as he impacts the ball harder than almost everyone in the minors, and his exit velocities would put him in an elite big-league company. In addition to his immense strength, he also has ridiculous bat speed. The swing is upper body-based, and he’s upright and still at the plate, except for the unorthodox hand pump he uses to pre-load. He still gets his hands in the right position, and he can stay back and make adjustments because his hands are so quick to the ball. He’s improved his plate approach, but there are some swing-and-miss concerns. His contact rate in Triple-A was barely over 70%, so the strikeouts will always be a significant part of his game. He didn’t get his first big league call-up in 2024 until August. It likely would have been sooner, but he missed significant time in the minors after fracturing a rib when he leaped into the dugout to try and catch a foul ball. When he came up, he wasn’t getting regular playing time due to the contact issues and wasn’t able to earn more either. He finished his limited 2024 sample with a near 48% strikeout rate, which is unplayable. He’s good enough at third base to make all the routine plays, and his arm strength is a plus, but he gets dinged a bit because his throws are often inaccurate and sail on him, and he lacks lateral range. His likely best future fit is at first base, but he runs well enough, and his arm is a weapon that I wouldn’t hesitate to try him on in right field. Mayo seems destined to return to Triple-A to start 2025 and will ride the Norfolk to Baltimore shuttle. The severe contact issues have slightly dropped his stock as we enter 2025. - Matt Thompson

Scouting Report

Walker Jenkins is a divisive prospect because some people are clinging to his pre-draft scouting reports instead of focusing on what he did in his first full pro season. He's a well-built athlete, though he's likely maxed out physically for his age. Jenkins brings easy plus bat speed and a mostly linear bat path, which allows him to cover pitches all over the zone. While he shows some ability to adjust his bat path, he generally sticks to a linear approach. The main issue—and part of why we're lower on him than others—is that his power hasn't been as present as you'd want for someone billed as a significant power threat. He shows solid power and could become a plus-power hitter if he lifts more batted balls. He's already got a feel for pulling the ball, but his power is held back by that linear path, which limits how often his raw power shows up in games. There's upside here for glass-half-full folks: he's making a ton of quality contact and sprays hard line drives all over the park. If he starts lifting more, we might see that plus raw power translates into game power. In the field, Jenkins is playing center and can hold his own there to an extent, but his range isn't ideal. He makes solid jumps and reads, but most major league teams will have better options for center. With a plus arm, he's more than suited for a corner spot, and right field is likely his long-term defensive home. We have him as a 55 OFP because we believe that power will start to translate into game power; we just don't envision him as a top 5 prospect like some others might at this time, more comfortably a top 25 prospect. - Rhys White

Eldridge was everywhere in 2024, starting his season in Single-A and ending the regular season with a Triple-A cameo before playing in the Arizona Fall League. This was Eldridge’s first taste of full-season ball and also his first full-season exclusively as a hitter. He was a prominent pitching prospect but the Giants convinced him to give up pitching prior to the 2024 season. Despite his frame and being in the upper minors as a teenager, Eldridge showed above-average contact skills and excellent swing decisions. The big exit velocity numbers and ability to lift the ball point to 35+ homer potential and it might even be more than that if in a different park. He doesn’t sell out for power and actually has a swing geared more towards making contact. He will play all of the 2025 season as a 20 year old and seems likely to begin the season in Double-A, where he only played in nine games before moving to Triple-A and getting in eight games. Despite the busy 2024 he was still sent to the Arizona Fall League and the Giants used it as an opportunity for him to improve his defense at first base which is still a relatively new position for him. He has spent some time in right field previously but he’s a poor fit out there, especially in his home park. Eldridge will likely make his big league debut late in 2025 and enter 2026 as their regular first baseman. - Matt Thompson

Scouting Report

The former Virginia standout has hit the ground running as a professional and is on the verge of making the major leagues. He is a well-built catcher with the requisite mass on his frame to withstand the bumps and bruises associated with the position. Teel is a solid presenter of the ball; at times, he can get a bit jabby and isn't the most fluid in how he receives pitches, but for the most part, he looks like a league-average framer. He steals strikes on the lower corners better than those in the strike zone. He is a willing and able blocker of balls in the dirt, and when he drops to one knee, he likes to kick his leg out. Teel is an explosive athlete, especially for his position, and he pops up quickly from his stance to put himself in the best position to get his throws off. His arm is average based on throw speed to the naked eye, but he is accurate enough to deter slower runners without completely halting the running game. He is upright in his batting stance with a slight bend to his knee, and he explodes toward the ball with his leg kick. He generates a lot of rotation through his hips and base, which allows him to have above-average power, especially on his pull side. He shows advanced barrel malleability, attacking pitches up in the zone by straightening out his bat path and adding some loft to pitches that are lower than belt-high. There are some slight issues with pitches that break in on his hands, but for the most part, he is an above-average hitter. He feels good about going the other way when pitchers try to spot soft stuff outside. There's some chase in his game, which inflates his strikeout rate to slightly above average, but he offsets this with an above-average walk rate due to his patience. Teel is the rare complete catching prospect who is average to above average in every game aspect. He looks capable of taking on the lion's share of work in Boston as early as Opening Day next season if the Red Sox want him to. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

Before he even signed as a professional, there were talks about what if Cam Smith lifted and pulled the ball more, and almost immediately upon signing, he began doing so. The Cubs got him to get out in front of batted balls, and now Cam Smith looks like one of the best picks in the draft and was the primary piece in the trade that netted the Cubs Kyler Tucker from the Astros. Cam Smith is a well-built athlete with plenty of muscle on his frame. There are some slight concerns he might get too big and have to move off third base, but as currently constructed, he has good enough instincts and reflexes, and an above-average arm helps. In the batter's-box, Cam Smith must have been instructed to have a more linear bat path with a more all-fields approach during his time at Florida State, and then the Cubs got him to get out a touch quicker, especially on pitches to all fields, and that slight change has allowed him to translate that raw power you would expect from someone who is 6'3" 224 pounds. He has always had good swing decisions, allowing him to attack pitches all over the strike zone. Even with the new swing decisions, his power plays to all fields, as he will take the ball the other way with authority. Smith's post-draft outlook is much rosier than his pre draft outlook, and now he looks to be a top 50 prospect, with upside for much more. The Astros saw the lift-and-pull approach and wanted to get in that business with the Crawford Boxes while being a league-average defender at an important defensive position. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

The Mets, since the arrival of David Stearns and much of the old Brewers front office, have transformed into a pitching factory, developing and optimizing arms in ways their fans haven't seen before. Their determination to make Brandon Sproat a part of this apparatus was evident, drafting him in back-to-back years. It's easy to see why—his sub-6-foot release point on most pitches, combined with a higher three-quarters arm slot, makes him one of the more intriguing pitching prospects in the minors. While Sproat's fastball boasts plus-plus velocity, it has a suboptimal shape. He managed to get by with it at lower levels, but upper-minor hitters have been able to do damage due to its straightness or its "dead-zone" characteristics. Improving its shape could unlock more from his arsenal. His cutter, which plays off the fastball, is below average and suffers from the fastball's lack of movement. However, his slider has solid horizontal break and could be used more effectively. Sproat's curveball is a true hammer with plenty of break, making it a weapon down in the zone or early in counts. But the star of his repertoire is the changeup, which features tremendous fading action and is so effective that he confidently uses it against same-handed hitters. Everything but the fastball and cutter looks like it came straight from a pitching lab. If he can improve the shape of his fastball, Sproat has the potential to be a 60 OFP arm. As it stands, the fastball limits him to more of a 55 OFP profile. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

From the outset of his pro career, Miller looked the part despite being 19 years old. One year later, there’s room to grow into his frame, but Miller has the type of stature that gives him an immense ceiling: a high-waisted and efficiently built body. Miller’s hands clear the zone with ease and generate plus bat speed, showing an ability to clear the inner and upper portions of the zone. His swing suggests that Miller will be able to minimize strikeouts and end up with a very palatable strikeout rate, given the power projection. For a young player, Miller’s approach is very professional, which has allowed him to rise through the MiLB ranks. Miller hasn’t emerged with consistent game power yet, but there’s easy plus raw power here that he will likely tap into as he comes into his own and begins playing competition in his age range. A couple of years from now, 25 to 30 home runs will be the expectation when he’s given a consistent big-league opportunity. Impressively, Miller has only played shortstop in the pros thus far after being discussed as a third baseman in draft circles. There’s average lateral quickness and overall speed here, which lends Miller average shortstop ability now, but he may ultimately see a tick down in quickness as he physically matures. Even then, there is real potential for Miller to end up an average shortstop, which makes him an even more tantalizing prospect than initially thought. In any event, Miller fits on the left side of the infield, where his plus arm will be fun to watch for years to come. - Tyler Paddor

Scouting Report

Burns lit the NCAA on fire during his three year career, showcasing some of the best power stuff we’ve seen in years and doing it under control. The 6-foot-3 Burns looks the part with a high-waist and well developed 6-foot-3 frame. He’s extremely athletic on the mound with a lightning quick arm. His mechanics are largely clean and simple, though there’s effort in his drive and follow-through. Burns throws from a higher 3/4 slot. The headliner here is the easy, upper-90s heater. Burns averages around 98 and with hellacious spin that creates above average carry that--along with the velocity--helps to miss plenty of bats for a fastball. Burns higher arm slot nullifies some of the spin based movement and creates more typical shape, rather than resembling a double-plus or elite offering. In part because of the hittable shape and Burns imperfect command, his fastball gets hit hard, especially by left-handed bats. It’s easy to imagine Burns becoming more intentional with fastball location and getting better results, but he’ll need to display that in pro ball. What makes Burns a surefire big leaguer and potential top of the rotation arm is his double-plus 2900 rpm slider. It sits in the upper-80s with a huge hook shape, making it nearly unhittable. The slider drops heavily late and also has above average gloveside break. It already profiles as one of the better breaking balls in the sport. Burns mixes in a steep power curveball with similar characteristics to his slider, though Burns does not have the same premier feel for it. It has plus characteristics and could be a key to defeating left-handed bats. Burns rarely uses his upper-80s changeup and its shape is inconsistent but it flashes plus potential with heavy fade and could be the true key to correcting his left-handed splits. Burns has the confidence to attack the zone which largely leads to success but his fastball is left hittable far too often, leading to most of the damage done against him. Burns' fastball will likely never be double-plus but some improvements with fastball location could turn him into a top-10 prospect in the sport. In the meantime, the inconsistency of his changeup leaves some platoon risk that could make Burns too exploitable to left-handed bats to be a top of the rotation starter. - Tyler Paddor

Scouting Report

Mathews may have raised his profile more than any other pitcher in minor league baseball in 2024 as he surged from Single-A to Triple-A, making 26 starts and posting a cumulative 2.76 ERA with 202 total strikeouts in 143 ⅓ innings. Because of that performance, Mathews was the 2024 Prospects Live Minor League Pitcher of the Year. The former Stanford Cardinal has a tall, lean frame, and he attacks hitters from a low ¾ arm slot from a drop-and-drive setup. He’s added some velocity in pro ball and also around 20 pounds of muscle to the frame. He now sits 94-95 with above-average carry, making the fastball a plus pitch. His changeup is a plus, offering tunnels off of the fastball, which he uses in and out of the zone for strikes and whiffs. His slider is also an above-average pitch, albeit with inconsistent shape. He has a starter’s arsenal and made significant command improvements last year while displaying durability and the ability to work deep into games consistently. Mathews checks all the boxes and gets enough whiffs to headline a rotation potentially. He’s in a position to make his debut in 2025 but will start the season in Triple-A. - Matt Thompson

Marcelo Mayer was putting together a fantastic season in Double-A before a lumbar strain shut him down at the end of July. His smooth, aesthetically beautiful swing can drive the ball to all fields. Mayer often takes an opposite-field approach, mainly when behind in counts. He’s a patient hitter with solid zone recognition and rarely chases terrible pitches. His over-the-fence power comes mostly to his pull side at present, but there could be more still to come. In the field, Mayer has a good arm that should ultimately allow him to play in either position on the left side of the dirt. An injury held Mayer back from potentially flying through the upper levels of the minors this past season, but he was showing off the skills that made him highly touted on draft night. Mayer has the makings of a shortstop who can be slotted near the top of a future Red Sox lineup. - Trevor Hooth

Scouting Report

If the Dodgers call about one of your prospects, it may be best not to hang up because they got Zyhir Hope in a 40-man consolidation trade along with Jackson Ferris for Michael Busch. The former UNC commit is a well-built athlete with plenty of muscle all over his body, especially in his lower half, where he is tightly wound. He is a good athlete as currently constructed, but he is bound to slow down, and that hurts him in the field. He is already rough in the outfield and is likely limited to left field because of some rough reads he takes to batted balls and not great routes to batted balls. This will be mitigated in left field, but as a result, there will be more pressure on his bat. Hope is a data darling with an optimized swing and enough contact skills to tap into his tremendous raw power. His swing is geared toward lifting batted balls because he loves to get out in front of fastballs and take them to his pull side. This results in him having some yellow flags about hitting soft stuff away, and this season in High-A will be an interesting test as we will have a better chance of evaluating how he handles softer stuff that breaks away from him. The bat speed is comfortable, and when he makes contact, it is loud. I caught him smashing a ball 455 feet at a game I attended this year. The ceiling with Zyhir Hope is one of the game’s premier power bats, who can do a bit of everything except play center-field. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

Smith had Tommy John surgery during his high school career, but that didn't stop scouts from considering him during the 2021 draft. He ultimately made it to Arkansas, and while the command was in question for the first two seasons, he beefed up and began to throw more strikes, allowing his draft stock to soar. During the 2024 season, Smith struck out 161 batters across 84 innings, including 17 batters alone during an outing against Oregon State in February. The White Sox signed Smith as a top-five pick and signed him to a hefty $8 million bonus. Smith's arsenal is diabolical. His heater is an underappreciated monster in the public space. His velocity crept into the upper 90s, touching 100 MPH numerous times, with a low release, flat approach angle, and extreme deception thanks to his crossfire delivery. It's a legitimate double-plus heater that posted a whiff rate north of 40% in 2024. The mid-80s slider is another double-plus pitch with deadly bite and two-plane break that hitters struggle to pick up. It tunnels off the heater well, and the pitch plays very well down in the zone when he's on. He'll also firm up the shape and throw a cutter-esque pitch closer to 90 MPH. The splitter was utilized more in the spring, flashing good depth and some tumble away from righties. He's gaining a feel for the offering, and it's an average offering right now, though he'll see an upgrade shortly with more development. He projects to fly through the minor leagues and should reach the majors as early as 2026, as his dynamic one-two punch and improved command provide a loud upside in a starting role. - Tyler Jennings

Scouting Report

Jac Caglianone, selected sixth overall by the Kansas City Royals in the 2024 MLB Draft, is a remarkable two-way talent with significant potential as a left-handed power hitter and pitcher. At the University of Florida, he led Division I with 33 home runs in 2023 and 35 in 2024, showcasing exceptional raw power and bat speed. While his aggressive approach previously resulted in a 44% chase rate, he made notable improvements in 2024, reducing his strikeouts and enhancing contact quality. Defensively, Caglianone is solid at first base, projecting as a key offensive contributor. His fastball reaches up to 100 mph on the mound, complemented by a developing cutter and a solid changeup. Despite refining his delivery, control issues persist, leading to elevated walk rates and raising questions about his long-term role as a two-way player. The Royals are open to exploring his dual capabilities, recognizing his profile's high-risk, high-reward nature. Caglianone's unique skill set and physical attributes position him as one of the most intriguing prospects in recent drafts. - Jared Perkins

Scouting Report

Jacob Wilson made his major league debut after a meteoric rise in the minor league. Wilson is one of the best contact hitters in all of the minor leagues and now projects to be this at the highest level after making his major league debut in 2024. Wilson is one of the game's premier bat-to-ball hitters with quick wrists and a fairly linear bat path. One of the only warts to Wilson's play is he loves to expand the strike zone, not because he has pitch recognition issues but because he has such excellent bat-to-ball skills that he thinks, and rightfully so, he can make contact with borderline pitches. Now, these aggressive swing decisions were exposed at the highest level, but that is such a small sample size that we are not taking too much from this sample. The exciting part is Wilson's power, especially in the manors. He won't ever blow you away with his EVs, but he can back-spin batted balls and have his power play closer to average. Wilson's quality of contact is rather high, and he is showing a bit more feel for pulling and lifting batted balls as he has become a professional. It is still an all-fields approach, but he does get out in front more on pitches on the inner third of the zone to try and pull them. There is some hope that if he becomes more patient as a hitter, the whole profile will take another step forward. Wilson is an average defender in the field, not the flashiest nor most twitchy, but he gets to the required batted balls and makes the routine play. He is never going to win a gold glove at shortstop, but he can hold his own there; his arm also helps this. Wilson is an elite contact hitter who can play shortstop; the ceiling is, what if Luis Arraez had a touch of lift and pull to his game and also played shortstop. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

The Marlins went pitcher-heavy at the top of the 2023 draft, taking Noble Meyer in the first round and following it up with the big lefty Thomas White in the Comp round. It’s very early, but White looks like the better arm, with two-plus pitches and the ability to touch 97. White has an easy delivery despite the long arm action. He attacks hitters from a low ¾ arm slot. His fastball sits around 95 with good carry and works best up in the zone. It’s a high-spin offering from a low slot. His primary off-speed pitch is a slurvy breaking ball, and he relies on it for a majority of his whiffs. It has been called a curveball and a slider due to the depth and sweeping action of the pitch. White’s changeup is his third pitch for now, but it also has the potential to be a plus pitch down the line. It has good shape, with late fade. He has done a much better job of throwing strikes. His command has jumped a full grade over the course of the 2024 season, and now he has average command and could improve if he manages to shorten his arm action. White looks like a number two starter, and if the changeup takes a step forward, the ceiling might even be higher. - Matt Thompson

Scouting Report

There might be no more physically imposing pitcher in the minor leagues than Jarlin Susana. He looks like a next-level athlete on the mound, especially compared to the low-minor hitters he faces. Despite his size, he's surprisingly limber and repeats his delivery much better than last year. His jump in command is impressive, allowing his entire arsenal to play up now that he's less erratic. Susana releases the ball from a standard three-quarters slot, and his fastball is among the best in the minors from a velocity standpoint. Only Ricardo Yean has a faster fastball (which I've seen in person). Though the fastball's shape is a bit dead-zone, the velocity reaching 103 mph makes shape less of a concern. His improved fastball command has elevated his profile, and he's experimenting with the shape, mixing in a two-seamer with arm-side run that complements his changeup, though the shape of the changeup still needs refinement. Velocity-wise, the fastball is elite, but the slider is the true headliner. It's a legitimate swing-and-miss pitch that he can ramp up to the mid-90s if needed. With hard bite, the slider consistently generates whiffs. The changeup is still rounding out and remains an inconsistent offering with variable feel, though he has time to refine or adjust the grip. Jarlin Susana is one of the most exciting raw arms in the minors. With his improved command, he now ranks among the best pitching prospects in baseball. His electric stuff, combined with developing pitchability, makes him an arm with enormous potential. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

Konnor Griffin could be an above-average third baseman or center fielder on an MLB roster. He has the potential to have five above-average to plus tools and provide quality defensive play at a premium position, but the question will be if his talent and tools end up translating against pro-level competition in the coming years. Griffin has a large frame that is mainly filled in; he has a very muscular build with broad shoulders and wide hips; despite being only 18 years old, his body is very mature, with his frame nearly being maxed out already. Griffin will likely grow off of shortstop in the next few years as his body finishes maturing and either shifts over; if he maintains the level of athleticism he has now, he will likely be able to hold down center at an above-average level but if he loses a touch of his explosiveness third will suit him better in the long run; he should be able to hold down the hot corner with his plus arm and average hands. At the plate, Griffin has an open stance, his hands start at ear level, he has a simple load, and he utilizes a slight leg kick and stride to time up pitchers. His swing path is steep with above-average bat speed; Griffin’s approach will need some work as he progresses through pro ball, and his swing can get a bit long at times leading to some swing/miss; it may take him some time to adjust to pro competition but he has tons of raw power that could make him a serious offensive threat if he can refine his hitting abilities and stay short to the ball at the plate, allowing him to harness that power in game. With the potential to be a power-hitting premium position player, Griffin is a very interesting prospect; he’s toolsy, and at only 18 years old, he has quite a bit of time to refine his abilities in the minors, giving him the potential to be a power hitting above average to plus centerfielder or third-base in the future. - Alex Kempton

Scouting Report

The Brewers did what they do best here and scouted an arm from a smaller school. The Brewers drafted the tall, thin right-hander from Crowder College in Missouri. It was the highest bonus they would hand out in the 2022 draft. Misiorowski stands out when he takes the mound in a multitude of ways. The primary reason is his unusual build. He's a big presence on the mound, even more so when you factor in his unusual delivery. He has no fear on the mound and goes right at hitters with one of the fastest arms in the minors. His arm speed causes some issues with him timing-wise, though, as the rest of his long frame struggles to sync up with his arm sometimes, and he can completely lose the strike zone. The stuff is loud and the best pure stuff in the minor leagues. He averages 98 with the fastball but routinely hits triple digits with a low release due to top-tier extension. He gets down the mound, and the fastball is on top of the hitter. It's an 80 fastball when you factor in velocity and the unique characteristics of the pitch. He also has a pair of plus-plus-breaking balls in his slider and curveball. His power curveball is in the mid-80s and has a two-plane break. He has a harder, flatter version in the mid to upper 80s that also piles up swings and misses. He's added a cutter to the mix and will also throw a changeup. Misiorowski has a long history of struggling to throw strikes. The Brewers put him in the bullpen in the minors late in the season, and he threw more strikes in that role. They should initially run him back out as a starter in the minors, but he could also turn into a valuable late-inning relief arm. The command drops him a half grade or so, but Misiorowski has the stuff to either headline a rotation or a bullpen. - Matt Thompson

2024 was a lost season for Lawlar, but don’t let it distract you from one of the most attractive profiles in the minors. He needs to put together a consistent string of health and that might be the biggest red flag, but if he does that, his stock will rise to the upper echelons of prospect lists quickly. His hit tool is a work in progress still, but there are plenty of flashes of upside in that tool. He has quick hands and good bat speed, so with more consistent reps I have hope he can improve this quickly. The power is what makes the bat so intriguing, as he shows lots of raw power for a guy at his position. The bat in general has potential in every way, but it’s hard to judge someone with such inconsistent playing time and practically a fully missed season in 2024. How he comes out of the gates in 2025 will say a lot about how close the bat is to contributing in the big leagues. The defense, however, is without a doubt ready and it is a shame the Diamondbacks have him blocked at shortstop. Lawlar has an incredibly fluid body and he covers lots of ground in the dirt. Combine that with an above average arm and he can play anywhere on the dirt at a high level. The speed is double plus, although he might be weary on the bases long term if the injury bug continues to be a problem. The combination of elite defense at a premium position and power potential make him an easy prospect to love, and it’ll be interesting to see how the DBacks plan to fit him into their team in 2025. First, he has to show he can stay healthy for a long stretch and continue to improve with the bat. - Grant Carver

Scouting Report

Drake Baldwin has had a slow and steady climb through the Braves' minor league system and is now on the verge of breaking through. His standout trait is what he can do offensively as a catcher. Baldwin is a solidly built player with muscle all over. He has a quick bat through the zone and shows an excellent feel for manipulating the barrel to attack pitches all over the zone. He lofts balls to the pull side and pokes them the other way when pitched outside. His power is average, generated through good bat speed and strength. As a catcher, Baldwin is solid as a blocker, and there's no issue with his receiving or game-calling. He could benefit from being on one knee more often, though. His arm is a concern—while his throws are accurate, they lack the zip you'd want. Even at the lower levels, opponents have picked up on this and run on him frequently. Baldwin is an average catcher overall and could remain there as a solid offense-first backup for a team. But with his athleticism, he could also transition to left field or first base, where his bat would still play well. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

The Cardinals signed Hence away from an Arkansas commitment as part of their strong 2020 draft. The undersized right-hander is certainly smaller and less physical than his listed height and weight, and he has dealt with some health issues for most of his pro career, eclipsing the 90-inning threshold just once. In 2024 alone, he missed time with chest and shoulder tightness and left his final appearance of the year with a lat issue. It was impressive stuff and command while he was healthy, and the Cardinals added him to the 40-man roster following the season. Hence sits 93-95 on his fastball and gets above-average ride on the pitch. His fastball command is plus, and the rest of his arsenal is just as impressive. His best secondary is his changeup, a slower offering with good fade away from left-handers. There’s significant separation off of his fastball with the changeup sitting 82-84. His gyro slider is 83-87, and it's an above-average pitch. It has replaced his average curveball as his most used breaking ball. He has the type of arsenal where he can be successful against right-handers and left-handers, primarily pairing a different breaking ball with his fastball and change. Hence’s stuff and command comes without question but it all comes down to durability for the young right-hander. He should make his big league debut sometime in 2025 as long as he remains healthy and this is the type of stuff you potentially build a rotation around. - Matt Thompson

Scouting Report

Jett Williams could have been a part of the Mets' playoff push had it not been for a right wrist injury that sidelined him for a chunk of the season. Wrist injuries are notorious for sapping power, which was the case for Williams in 2024. Fortunately, power isn't his primary asset. What's particularly exciting about Williams is his transition to center field, a shift that pushes him up the defensive spectrum. While the Mets initially seemed to be grooming him for second base, his double-plus speed and ability to get great routes and jumps should make him a standout in the outfield. Offensively, the wrist injury affected his power output this year, but Williams doesn't profile as a thumper even at full health. His game is built around his speed and ability to slap the ball into gaps, taking advantage of his wheels to cause havoc on the basepaths. His swing is notably flat and linear, enabling him to effectively handle pitches throughout the zone. Williams projects as an ideal, old-school leadoff hitter, a guy who will excel in getting on base, wreaking havoc with his legs, and playing solid defense in center field. While his power might max out at 12-15 homers in his peak years, his speed, defensive versatility, and disciplined approach will more than make up for the lack of pop, making him a valuable piece for the Mets' future. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

As pitchers and catchers reported news came out that Rosario would require elbow surgery that will keep him out for the entire 2025 season. The team did not fully commit to calling it Tommy John, but said it’s likely that. Rosario has a smooth motion and throws from a standard 3/4 arm slot. It appears he works from the right side of the mound, which adds another layer of uncomfortableness with same-handed hitters. He works primarily with a fastball, curveball, and changeup. His fastball sat in the upper-90’s prior to the injury. It plays well in the upper third, but he liked to move it all around the zone. His mid-80’s slider has plenty of depth to it. There is a short breaking version that he front doors righties with, or he can make it run out of the zone with more of a slurvy shape. His splitter gets good downward action. What helps these pitches play so well was not only the movement they have, but also the way Rosario can attack the different parts of the zone with each of them. Command was the biggest question to Rosario, but he walked less than four percent of batters during the season, while striking out nearly 37 percent of them. This elbow injury complicates things, but he had the look of a mid rotation ceiling, if not higher. If the command gains and three above average or better pitches hold following elbow surgery, then he should have no problem reaching that ceiling. - Trevor Hooth

Scouting Report

If it weren't for Tommy John, his draft-eligible year, Grant Taylor would have been the Friday night starter for that loaded LSU national championship squad over Paul Skenes. Taylor has rarely been healthy, but when he has been healthy, he has been one of the most electric arms in all of baseball, and he showed that with a very brief stint in Single-A and Arizona Fall League. Taylor is a unit on the mound, and he has enough functional athleticism to repeat his delivery well enough that I think he has above-average command. He has a higher three-quarters arm slot. His fastball plays well from that arm slot where it gets on hitters and is an early and late count weapon. The fastball has plenty of carry up in the zone and is a legitimate chase pitch. He causes batters to look foolish when chasing up in the zone. He pairs that with an above-average cutter that is more high-80s and low-90s. It is a nice weapon for him when hitters have keyed in on the fastball and slider combo. The slider is a hard downer breaking ball that gets swings and misses in the zone, especially when sequenced with the fastball up and the slider down and away. The curveball plays at the bottom of the zone, and while it has good value, he should use it more early in counts to steal a strike. The changeup flashes higher than plus, as it just falls off the table. He tunnels it well with his fastball, and because of how much movement he gets on it, it makes up for the lack of separation one might want from a "change of pace of pitch." The fastball and slider headline Taylor's arsenal to right-handed batters, but he can use the fastball-changeup combo to carve through lefties. The cutter and curveball are third pitches to either side of the batter's box, but they give him offerings early in counts to set up the two-plus secondaries. The issue with Taylor is that he seldom pitched in college or as a professional, so this ranking may be aggressive, but the stuff gives him a chance to be a good number three in a rotation if he can stay healthy, which is a big if. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

Horton was limited to just over 34 total innings in 2024 and saw a noticeable decline in stuff when he was on the mound. He dealt with a pair of lat injuries, the first led to missed time in June, and then he re-injured the same muscle in his rehab, and the Cubs elected to shut him down for the season. His fastball took a step back, dropping in velocity and losing some carry, but the lat injury likely is the culprit. He started the season in Double-A but quickly moved to Triple-A Iowa after just four starts, where he missed bats and showed excellent command. Horton is a good athlete who repeats his delivery very well. He's shown above-average command of his entire arsenal and can maneuver pitches wherever he wants in the strike zone. When healthy, the fastball is a plus pitch, sitting 94-97 with above-average movement, but in 2024, it was more 93-94. His slider is the headliner here, and the bottom falls out of it, and it leads to plenty of swing and miss. He changed his changeup grip late in the 2023 season to more of a split change, and while it gets a good amount of whiffs, he doesn't command it well. Everything comes back to his health and the fastball here, though; those two things will go hand in hand. With him being a three-pitch guy now, he will need that fastball to set up the plus slider since it's mostly utilized as a chase pitch. If the fastball bounces back, it gives him two plus offerings with a changeup that flashes, and he can be a solid number two in his prime years with that arsenal. Horton is back and throwing in the off-season and should be ready this spring. - Matt Thompson

Scouting Report

Moore is a uniquely intriguing profile and likely has the highest ceiling of anyone in this system. The body was built for impact with big time strength, and it fits his style of play perfectly. He has legit plus raw power and has shown some exciting exit velocities everywhere he has played. Second base prospects rarely have the level of thump that this guy has, and the only question is if he will get to it enough in game. The hit tool is a massive work in progress still due to both an overaggressive approach and swing-and-miss issues. His short debut in pro ball last year brought some impressive highlights, but he was also running a 37% Whiff Rate and a 38.8% Chase Rate. He needs to improve in both of those categories if he wants the bat to reach its potential, and the Angels need to give him that time in the minors to do so. With the glove, he’s fine at second but doesn’t move all that well side to side and it leaves him with limited range. The arm is fringy as well, making him more of a fringy defender overall, but he should be good enough to stick at the position. He does have some solid speed and is smart on the base paths, so value is there on the bases. It’s easy to see the ceiling of a potential impact second baseman that draws amazing character reviews at every stop, but the hit tool concerns are certainly there and need to be addressed. Here's hoping the Angels allow him time to develop and don’t force him to the Majors early in 2025. - Grant Carver

Scouting Report

The Nationals love a high-octane arm, and Travis Sykora fits that to a tee. He’s massive at 6’6”, with long arms and disproportionately long legs. The challenge with pitchers his size is that it often takes time to sync up the upper and lower body. His delivery is a bit disjointed right now, but to his credit, Sykora doesn’t let this affect his command. This could signal even better command down the road as he gets his mechanics fully aligned. He releases the ball from a three-quarters arm slot and uses varied timing—like an extended leg kick or a slight side-step—to disrupt hitters’ timing. Sykora’s fastball, which touched triple digits in high school, now comfortably sits at 94-97 mph with good life at the top of the zone, and he’s unafraid to elevate it to generate whiffs. His slider is another weapon, featuring hard vertical bite and consistently inducing swings and misses, though its command lags behind the fastball, likely something that will improve with experience. His split changeup is particularly effective against left-handed batters, offering more tumble than fade and causing hitters to swing over it, primarily due to how well it tunnels off the fastball. The main challenge with his changeup is consistency; while it flashes as a solid, above-average pitch, he occasionally throws below-average ones in outings. Sykora faces the typical risks of a pitcher who hasn’t advanced beyond Single-A, but with his dominance in 2024 across three pitches and developing command, he projects at minimum as a league-average starter, with the potential for more if the slider and split-change continue to improve. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

Jackson Chourio’s brother is more than just someone skating by on his brother’s last name—he is a legitimate prospect in his own right. Jaison is a bit different than his brother in the batter’s box, being more of a contact-oriented sort of hitter, as opposed to the potential five-tool talent that Jackson is. We could waste our time with more comparisons to his brother, but that’s not why we are here. Jaison is a smooth athlete, and his smoothness shows up in all facets of his game. He is an easy plus runner with plenty of quick twitch. He makes excellent reads in center and has more than enough range to make life easier for his corner outfielders. The arm is fine in centerfield, especially when you factor in his ability to flip his hips and trackballs hit above his head. He won’t make many mistakes in centerfield. His speed shows up on the basepaths, where he was an impressive 44-for-55. While he is still working on setting up pitchers, he has the burst and the footspeed to be an asset on the bases. He could be among the league leaders in stolen bases when his base-running savviness takes a step forward with more time and experience. His swing doesn’t have the loft that Jackson has (that’s the last comparison, I promise), but he shows the same level of contact that his brother did at this age. It’s a linear bat path with not much-wasted movement in his swing or pre-pitch setup, outside of a slight leg kick. He is able to attack pitches all over the zone because of the quickness of his bat through the zone, as well as the lack of wasted movement in his swing. He doesn’t chase at an alarming rate. You could argue he is too passive at the plate at times and could stand to get more aggressive with his swing decisions, but that should come with experience against better pitching that can spot and sequence their offerings. Chourio’s other issue is that, as currently constructed, he doesn’t hit the ball hard or have much loft in his swing, which causes what might be slightly below-average power to be comfortably below average. The power ceiling will ultimately determine how high his overall ceiling is—whether he can be an above-average regular because of his hit tool, speed, and glove or more than that if the power plays up a half-tick or more. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

If it hadn’t been for a labrum injury requiring season-ending surgery, we might have seen Jefferson Quero make his major league debut with the Brewers in 2024. Quero is one of the better defensive catchers in the low minors, as he is a polished defensive catcher with an easy plus arm. He blocks balls well, has a great understanding of getting his body in front of batted balls, and really wants to be behind the dish. He communicates well with his pitchers and has gotten rave reviews for how he calls games and how he interacts with his pitchers. Quero is a good receiver with quick wrists and can frame borderline pitches well. Quero is an excellent two-way catcher, as he should be at least a league-average bat. But there is a level swing, with which his raw strength allows him to have above-average power. He likes to get out in front and pull batted balls to tap into his power. There is some aggressiveness with breaking balls in and out of the zone, which is alarming and raises some yellow flags when you watch his 2023 tape. Pitches on the outer third of the zone, he will struggle to get to with his very pull-heavy approach. But he might lift and pull to a 100-110 wRC+ in his best years. Quero has a chance to be a Gabriel Moreno-esque defender for the Brewers while also proving to be a solid league-average bat. The Brewers, having a tandem of Quero and William Contreras, will immediately be one of the best tandems in the sport. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

The Martian made his major league debut last year but suffered a right UCL tear in September, which shut down his season. After recovering from Tommy John surgery, he was activated but then suffered a left oblique injury in June, just four games later. He is now 30 at-bats away from graduating from prospect status. Domínguez remains the same athlete he has been since coming stateside, built like an old-school fullback or linebacker. As a switch-hitter, he generates similar plus-plus bat speed from both sides of the plate. His setup is simple: a slight leg kick and a quick bat through the zone. The left-handed swing has more loft than the right-handed one, which tends to get pretty linear, resulting in less impact upon contact and more line drives and ground balls. The left-handed swing, however, has effortless plus-plus power. Domínguez makes solid swing decisions but has some issues chasing pitches out of the zone, especially vertically inclined breaking balls and changeups. He has average range for a center fielder in the outfield with solid jumps, although his reads off the bat can be a bit dicey. Ultimately, he’s likely to move to a corner outfield spot, and the fact that he couldn’t beat out Alex Verdugo for a spot there says a lot about how the Yankees view him. His arm was plus before Tommy John surgery, but it has since scaled down a grade. Jasson Domínguez is one of the highest-profile and most divisive prospects in recent memory. Once considered a sure-fire Hall of Famer, his prospect stock has fluctuated wildly, and he has now settled in as a 55 OFP prospect. He should become a 25-28 homer threat with above-average speed and arm strength, ultimately becoming a below-average defender in a corner outfield position. - Rhys White

Starlyn Caba has the potential to be an above-average to plus player in the MLB; his bat still needs to develop a bit to allow him to hit for average more consistently, and while hitting for power will most likely never be a massive part of his game he is a plus-plus SS who can impact games at the position. Caba has a small, wiry frame that still has room to fill in and get stronger; he moves very well with excellent lateral quickness, allowing him to be very rangey at SS and get good jumps on the basepaths, leading to an ability to steal bases often. At the plate, Caba has a slightly open stance, a slight leg kick and stride, good bat-to-ball skills, and average bat speed. Caba has solid plate discipline. He may need to improve his pitch recognition a bit as he continues to face more advanced pitching, but he has an adaptable swing that will allow him to compete with competitive pitching if he can increase his bat speed a bit as he finishes filling in his frame and gets stronger overall he has the potential to tap into a little bit of power leading to impact player potential. Caba is a plus-plus fielder; he has very smooth hands and natural instincts and makes difficult plays at SS look effortless; he could easily play any position in the IF and will stick at SS. Caba will need to retain his athleticism as he finishes filling in his frame to remain the great fielder he is; if he can do this and continue to develop as a hitter for average, he has the potential to be an impact player in the MLB in the future. - Alex Kempton

A down year 2024 saw Colson Montgomery hit just .214 as a 22-year-old in Triple-A with a strikeout rate shy of 30 percent. However, Montgomery had a short AFL stint following the season, where he hit and hit with plenty of power. He starts with a slightly open stance with his hands near the top of his head. He utilizes a standard stride as a loading mechanism. At the plate, his power is the carrying tool. He’s strong and lifts the ball, resulting in plenty of home run juice. He displays good patience and strike zone knowledge, which can result in walks or getting deep into counts. Montgomery has shown the ability to go with pitches but can be caught looking to pull and max out his pop. While he doesn’t stand out with the glove, he does have the skills to stay short, highlighted by an above-average arm. Unless he plays himself out of the position, there’s little standing in his way from being the everyday shortstop for the White Sox. He didn’t hit like a top-100 prospect but was also young for the level. He still showed the same plate skills that would suggest better statistical outputs are in the tank, just like in the Arizona Fall League. The way Chicago was last season leaves room for Montgomery to get a chance in the big leagues sooner rather than later. - Trevor Hooth

Since being drafted in the second round in 2023, Keaschall has hit and hit well at three different stops, ascending into the 50-75 range on global top prospect lists along the way until his season was cut short by TJ surgery down the stretch of his 2024 campaign. Keaschall starts the load in his right-handed swing early, with a high hand set, slight bat tip, and medium-sized leg kick, all characteristics of a swing he has been applying in a much more disciplined fashion since he transitioned to pro ball. Indeed, the appeal in the profile is a well-rounded offensive skill set. Keaschall doesn’t strike out much (17.2% in 2024), walks plenty (13.4% in 2024), and has strong bat-to-ball skills (80.7% Contact% in 2024). Increased patience (38.2% Swing%) compared to his college approach allowed Keaschall to access more offensive impact, with 15 home runs (37 XBH) and a .903 OPS across two MiLB levels, raising the power ceiling on what Keaschall might become when fully formed. Keaschall is a gifted athlete (he wrestled previously), with a strong lower half and quick wrists that allow him to get to solid average power, most going to the pull side. Keaschall combines above-average speed and savvy baserunning ability, going 23-29 in stolen base attempts in 2024. Defensively, there are question marks in his profile. The Twins have tried Keaschall at second base and center field (although he spent much time DHing in 2024 with his arm injury). He has the actions and athleticism to handle both despite a fringy arm. It’s hard to assess his defense given his injury and subsequent surgery, but hammering down a defensive home where he can be solid average will be a factor in weighing future value. Nonetheless, there’s enough to like in an offensive profile with no glaring flaw that cements Keaschall as a back-half industry top-100 prospect heading into 2025, where he should see AAA quickly, health permitting. - Jamie Cameron

The Rays selected the North Carolina-born Isaac with the 29th overall pick in the 2022 MLB Draft. Listed at 6-foot-4 and 240 pounds, the left-handed hitting first baseman/DH is an imposing figure at the plate, possessing effortless power and impressive athleticism. What sets Isaac apart from other sluggers is that his hit tool may be on par with his plus power. After slashing .285/.395/.521 with 19 home runs across 102 games in the '23 season, Isaac began this season at High-A Bowling Green, where he blasted 15 homers and posted a .916 OPS in 71 games. Isaac's approach at the plate is awe-inspiring for a young hitter. He exhibits advanced plate awareness and keen pitch selection, resulting in a professional 13% walk rate in 2024, although his strikeout rate of 33% is elevated compared to the '23 season. Despite his size, Isaac isn't just a one-dimensional slugger, as his high baseball IQ and advanced bat-to-ball abilities contribute to his well-rounded offensive profile. Defensively, the left-handed Isaac is currently limited to first base and DH. However, his athleticism and hand-eye coordination prevent him from being a liability in the field. Given his high fundamental floor, loud tools, and the Rays' aggressive organizational philosophy, Issac could ascend the minor league ladder quickly. While he may return to Double-A to begin the '25 season, he may reach Triple-A Durham as a 21-year-old, with a chance to make the big leagues towards the end of the season. - Brandon Williams

Purely talking about the movements during the load and swing mirror Yodan Alvarez, though De Paula’s barrel starts a little more upright. He has a lanky build, and already looks like an imposing force in the box. De Paula is patient at the plate and will look to drive pitches in the lower or inner third. The inner third is where he lifts the ball well, resulting in over the fence power. He drives the ball well when he makes contact, which isn’t limited to any field. De Paula is willing to use the entire field and go with the pitch. Defensively his game is not as polished. He can come in on balls well, but sometimes the routes on balls over his head could be improved. His arm is strong, but can be inaccurate. De Paula will be a corner outfielder if he stays on the grass, likely a left fielder. As he continues to age it would not be surprising if he moves to first or becomes mostly a DH. Success of De Paula’s profile will rely on his bat, but with his skills that is a good bet to make. - Trevor Hooth

There is the potential for some more power, but he will need to lift the ball more. He will turn 19 during the 2025 season, meaning he will still be very young for whatever level he’s at.

Ballesteros is one of the more interesting builds for a prospect you will see; he is a slightly taller Alejandro Kirk for a mental image. Ballesteros is an interesting spot because the Cubs don’t seem like they are in any rush to put him as their catcher despite him not being that bad behind the dish. Ballesteros has a simple setup on the plate, with little wasted movement. He does a slight toe tap and explodes towards the ball. He is a hit-over-power hitter who sprays hard-liners all over the field. His swing is relatively optimized for contact, but he can attack pitches all over the zone. There is a feel for back-spinning batted balls that allows him to “outslug his raw power”. He is an average power hitter who gets more of it in the game because his quality of contact is so high. He routinely barrels up batted balls. Behind the dish, he is better than you would think if you had wandered upon social media. He is still a below-average defender behind the dish, but his stock build allows him to get low and block batted balls in the dirt. The receiving part of his game needs some work, but that can be tightened up at the major league level. He possesses a plus arm that helps give him a better shot behind the dish. Ballesteros is a well-below-average athlete, which is fine, given that he is destined to be a catcher. Ballesteros’s bat is so good that the Cubs should have no issues fitting it in their lineup at some point in 2025, even if it is just as a first-baseman or even as a DH. He has a chance to be a hit in the middle of what should be a good Cubs lineup by the end of the season if everything goes right for Moisés Ballesteros. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

Cole Young probably is never going to be a prospect that gets the headlines, but he’s about as consistent of a producer as you can find. After being drafted in the first round out of Pennsylvania, Young found immediate success in the low minors and made his way to Double-A Arkansas at just 20 years old. The lefty shortstop has a simple, repeatable stroke at the plate that’s oriented to make mass amounts of contact, something he’ll do often when he’s at his best. Young has decent raw power, but it’s not a major part of his philosophy at the dish and plays down in games, limiting his game power. You might have a 15 homer season pop if everything comes together, but we’re more realistically looking at single digit homers as a big leaguer. Young attempts to steal bases at a relatively high clip, however he’s not quite explosive enough on the basepaths to make it work as often as you’d like to see at that volume. All but assured to start the year in Triple-A Tacoma, Young is slated to be a contributor at second base for Seattle as soon as this season and should have every shot to be a lineup regular for the coming years. He’s not going to blow you away with any one tool, but the more you watch Cole Young play baseball, the more you want him in your organization. Methodical and disciplined both on and off the field, expect Young to be a big league contributor in the near future. - Max Ellingsen

Scouting Report

East Carolina has churned out quite a few pitching prospects in recent years, including Gavin Williams and Carson Whisenhunt, but Yesavage has the chance to be the best of the group. A reliever his first year on campus, Yesavage’s command took a big jump forward in a starting capacity as a sophomore, and it continued as a junior, striking out 145 batters to the tune of a 2.03 ERA. Yesavage’s delivery is relatively stiff, and he works from an over-the-top slot, though he has above-average command of his arsenal and pumps strikes consistently. The higher slot hampers his fastball a bit, though the fastball averages over 20 inches of vertical break and plays well at the top of the zone. As a result, he missed bats at a 27% clip this spring, though that may come down in the minor leagues. However, his secondaries benefit from the high slot, and he attacks the vertical axis of the zone with excellent results. The mid-80s slider is a firm breaker with gyro break, acting like a cutter sometimes, though it missed bats over 55% of the time in 2024 despite its modest shape. The low-80s splitter took a massive jump in 2024 as Yesavage threw it at will with impressive tumble and command. It’s a true plus pitch with incredible results. There’s a low-80s curveball with massive depth in his back pocket, though he has yet to utilize it a ton, and it is projected to be an average offering. There’s a high-floor starter package here with mid-rotation starter upside, thanks to two plus pitches and excellent command. - Tyler Jennings

Scouting Report

Suarez was yet another lower-level trade acquisition by the Rays. They acquired him from the Marlins in the Xavier Edwards deal in November 2022. Suarez is a well-developed teenage right-hander with a large frame. He's already filled out and well above his listed weight of 175. It's a rhythmic delivery from an over-the-top arm slot. He rocks back and forth slightly before gathering and delivering towards the plate. His fastball sits 94-96 with above-average ride up in the zone. He runs into trouble with the fastball on the lower part of the zone, but when it's up, it will miss bats. His newest offering is his cutter, and it has the potential to be his best pitch. It's 88-91, gets a lot of weak contact, and misses bats at a slightly above-average rate. It's his primary put-away pitch against left-handers. His curveball is his primary put-away pitch against right-handers. It has two plane movements with some late sweep. His changeup often gets classified as a splitter due to the drop, but it's a changeup with inconsistent shape. It will get to average with refinement, but the rest of the arsenal works so well that he may not need to rely on it more than just as a show-me pitch. He has plus command of his entire arsenal, and it all plays up due to plus extension. Suarez is as advanced a 19-year-old pitching prospect as I've seen in quite some time. It's a mid-rotation ceiling here, and there is a chance for more if he can improve the consistency with the fastball and get a secondary to pop. - Matt Thompson

Scouting Report

Quero is one of the better hitters in the Sox system and has a chance to make an impact with the big league club soon. He is a switch hitter with an advanced feel for the bat and an above-average hit tool. There is not a lot of chase there, and he runs solid contact rates, so the hit tool should translate to the next level. The power is solid, but he lacks the top-side exit velocities that would give him impact power potential going forward. He made significant progress in the game power department in 2024 compared to 2023, but it’s still average or so power going forward for me. The glove is good enough to stick at catcher for now, but it is not anything to write home about. His best feature behind the plate is probably his arm, which has solid strength, and he throws out base runners at a nice clip. There is not much foot speed here, and he won’t add value to that side of the game. Quero might not have the highest ceiling in this system, but he has a bat that has proven it can play and is close to being ready for the big league. Throw in the fact that he should be able to stick at catcher going forward, and he is a legit part of the White Sox core in the future. He’ll get a chance to prove that with the big league team in 2025. - Grant Carver

Scouting Report

Cooper Pratt is someone that I don't know how the Brewers were able to float down to the 6th round and give him an over-slot deal. He has a long, lean frame with which you can project a little more muscle, but he and the Brewers have to decide how they want him to develop. They don't want him to lose any wiggle or lateral agility if he is to stay a shortstop. Pratt has an aesthetically pleasing swing, with a linear bat path that is geared towards getting the barrel on the ball. There is a noticeable lack of loft in his swing, which makes his average raw power tend to play down closer to below average. He shows good plate coverage, and his ability to attack pitches all over the zone gives him a high floor. The dream here is that his feel for barreling up pitches with some added strength may allow his power to be closer to average. Pratt is currently an average defensive shortstop with a good arm. He makes all the plays you expect, he can range decently well in the hole. He isn't the overly explosive or fluid athlete you want at short; however, he can get to batted balls on the ground, and his above-average arm allows him to get batters out at first because he can flip the ball over to first from a few different platforms. At the very least, Pratt projects out as a hit tool carried shortstop if the power never takes a step forward because he doesn't add more loft or strength. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

Last summer was an interesting time for Rainer. A two-way prospect from Harvard-Westlake, many thought Rainer could end up being an arm with an effortless delivery on the bump and budding stuff. However, Rainer became stronger and faster, allowing the bat to come to life as a senior. He torched opposing pitching with a mature approach and registered 110 MPH exit velocities at NHSI, boosting his stock significantly and winding up with a first-round selection by the Tigers. Rainer began to shorten his swing and move away from an opposite-field approach, lacing baseballs to all fields and showcasing plus raw power in batting practice. The biggest issue with his pull-side approach was corkscrewing himself into the ground, which went away during the spring. Given the projection and strength, Rainer could achieve plus in-game power in due time. He also stays within the zone and doesn’t chase a ton. His body type reminds scouts of Corey Seager and Colson Montgomery, though he has the tools to stick at shortstop. He moves fluidly and has the arm strength across the diamond to stick there, plus there are soft hands and a great internal clock. He’s an average runner underway, as well. Rainer should rise quicker than others his age. - Tyler Jennings

Scouting Report

Before his knee injury completely halted his season, Farmelo was well on his way to becoming a top-50 prospect; now, a knee injury has raised some questions, and we shall see how he comes back late in 2025. Before the injury, Jonny Farmelo was a loose and twitched-up athlete that the Mariners saved from going to the University of Virginia. He was one of the rangier defenders in the minors and showed that he had plus range in centerfield, thanks to some heady routes and plus-plus wheels. His arm is also an asset in center field, and if he returns back to full form, there is a chance Farmelo will be a gold glove caliber defender in centerfield because he can get batted balls in the gaps that your average center fielder can not. It's a pretty simple setup in the batter's box, and he is looking to get out in front of batted balls and spray them to all fields. The power was rounding up from his time as a prepster as he was noticeably more muscular as a professional. He projects out to have average power at the end of the day, with the chance for more if Farmelo adds more loft than he showed in 2024. His contact skills are good; he understands the strike zone and lays off borderline pitches. He also is not afraid to go up there and battle off pitches to work his way into advantageous hitter counts. If the power takes another step forward in a year or so, Farmelo will have a chance to be the rare five-tool prospect. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

Condon set the BBCOR home run record en route to a new signing bonus record. Condon struggled in his pro debut with an apparent thumb injury impacting his swing operation. Condon has a mammoth frame--one of the biggest position player frames in the sport--and there may be a little more growth left for Condon. Condon has a slight knee bend in his stance with an overall relaxed square setup. He coils subtly with a smooth easy swing. Condon gets some bend in his lower back, especially when recognizing a pitch lower in the zone which helps him stay on plane. At Georgia, Condon flashed a plus hit tool with above average bat to ball skills, plus pitch recognition, and average swing decisions to go along with thunderous impact and routine elevation of the baseball. In his pro debut, Condon looked out of sync, struggling majorly with breaking balls--a trend that could not be more opposite from his collegiate production where he OPS’ed 1.642 against breakers. Condon has shown an impressive ability to handle higher end velocity and cover all quadrants of the zone. While this was not evident in his pro debut, early season results will quickly show how detrimental Condon’s thumb injury actually was. Condon’s power tells its own story; Condon has double-plus raw power that he gets to in game frequently thanks to special barrel accuracy and a swing geared to elevate. Condon’s ceiling is that of a 40+ home run hitter. Defensively, Condon has shown great instincts and capability across the diamond having accumulated experience at all 4 corner defensive spots, along with center field. Condon profiles best in an outfield corner long-term, though the Rockies look to keep him ready at the hot corner. Because of his below average speed, Condon projects to be average in a corner but his range does not correlate with his speed, dispelling concerns he may have to play first base. Condon’s arm is borderline plus which further supports a corner outfield role. Condon’s pro debut triggered some alarm bells but with reports of a thumb injury, it’s too soon to conclude his collegiate production won’t translate. Condon still has the potential of an All-MLB talent, though his floor may not be as high as originally anticipated with some risk of becoming a quality everyday player. - Tyler Paddor

Scouting Report

Kevin Alcántara came over from the Yankees in the Anthony Rizzo trade. He's one of the higher-ceiling players in baseball with plus speed and power tools. Alcántara has four above-average to plus tools in his bag already. Unfortunately, the hit tool is lacking. The aggressiveness in the box and the length of his frame means he will be prone to high strikeout totals, but he's done a good job of keeping them in check, making improvements in 2022 and 2023 and essentially holding steady in 2024 when you factor in the climb in levels. As the season continued, Alcántara improved his contact rates in the minors and was a surprise promotion to the big leagues during the final week. He showed improved contact rates against fastballs and breaking balls as the season went on and did so without sacrificing any of that plus power. He was still hitting the ball hard but also expanding the zone, especially against softer stuff, and he will likely be a low-average hitter, even during his best seasons. It's a power-over-hit profile. Defensively, he's very good in center field, but with the presence of others there, he seems destined for right field, where his above-average arm will play. The clock is the biggest thing working against Alcántara; he only has one option remaining but still has plenty of hit tool development ahead of him. He will see Wrigley Field this year but might be better off in Iowa getting regular at-bats, at least initially. - Matt Thompson

Scouting Report

The Reds made Rhett Lowder the second collegiate arm off the board when they selected him seventh overall in the 2023. He would also become the second pitcher from the class to reach the majors following Paul Skenes when he made his big league debut in 2024. Lowder came from the world famous Wake Forest pitching lab and climbed all the way from High-A to MLB, touching every level in between, as he made his big league debut in his first professional season. Lowder has an average fastball that averages 92-94 but will also throw a sinker which gets a ton of groundballs. He has plus-plus command of the fastball and his overall strike throwing is impressive. Lowders ability to sequence and stay out of traditional fastball counts is impressive and he is able to get ahead and let his slider and changeup due the heavy lifting as far as missing bats are concerned. There is no plus pitch here though, no putaway pitch. He’s got an old school approach as he works the edges of the zone and spots all three pitches on the black. He stays out of the dangerous parts of the zone and he’s going to have to continue to do that in Great American Ballpark. Lowder is a big league ready number three starter and while he lacks the ceiling you traditionally see of someone coming off the board at number seven overall, he should still carve out a long and successful career in the middle of his teams’ rotations, health permitting of course. Lowder will be in the mix to break camp with the Reds. - Matt Thompson

Aidan Smith is another in a long line of prospects that, when the Rays ask about, it might just be best to hang up the phone. He came to Tampa from the Randy Arozarena trade. He’s a well-built athlete with a solid frame and some room to dream about him adding more muscle. He has a quick bat through the zone, and his swing hasn’t changed much from his time with the Mariners. He’s fairly upright in his stance and swing, but that hasn’t resulted in any issues for the 20-year-old. Smith already has an optimized swing, making good swing decisions and looking to lift and pull batted balls. He tends to lift for line drives rather than fly balls, utilizing a line-drive approach to all fields with the occasional pulled batted ball. He’s an explosive runner and spent more time in right field during his time with the Mariners, but he’s more than capable in center field. His arm strength was on display in right field, as he has above-average arm strength paired with good accuracy. He possesses the requisite range and jumps to be a solid defender in center field. He’s an above-average to plus defender in a corner due to how he handles slicing batted balls and the range he provides. Smith is one of the more impressive prospects I’ve seen this season, settling in as a 50 OFP with upside for more as his hit tool should only improve with more exposure to pro pitching. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

The Tigers decided to trade off Jack Flaherty at the trade deadline, and the headliner of their return was Thayron Liranzo. I have seen a lot of Thayron Liranzo, and there is much to like about the young catching prospect. When I saw him in Single-A, he was a flat-out no as a catcher; he wasn’t a comfortable receiver of the ball nor a competent blocker of the ball. But because of some good coaching and a noticeable uptick in enthusiasm behind the dish, he has gone from a 40 in my eyes to a 45 behind the dish with a chance to round out as an average defender. He is comfortable receiving vertically inclined breaking balls low in the zone and with horizontally inclined stuff that breaks away from him. He has taken a nice step forward as a blocker; while he still needs some work, there are some encouraging signs that while he is down on one knee, he can control, to an extent, balls from getting to the back-stop. As a hitter, Liranzo is a 55-hitter with 60 power from the left side and a 50-hitter with 60 power from the right side. He is just on the line for us on whether we think he should abandon the right-handed swing. As a left-handed hitter, he can attack pitches all over the zone more than he does as a right-handed batter. Liranzo’s swings don’t look dissimilar, but the results were wildly different given small samples. This will happen especially for switch-hitters from the right side, especially given the varying quality and quantity of left-handed pitchers in the low minors. If he ever did have to abandon one side, it’s great that the left side is better, even if it is just margina, by a half-grade. Liranzo has some pretty impressive power, and given an entire season of work, he could hit 25-28 homers a year while being a good enough catcher. If his catching chops take another leap forward, we could discuss one of the game’s more complete catchers. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

I stumbled upon my first look at Crisantes when I decided to go to a random camp day, and amongst the hoards of screaming children was the best Diamondbacks prospect I saw last year in Demetrio Crisantes. He has a stockier build and will never be mistaken for a supreme athlete on the baseball field. His value is tied to his ability to make quality contact. Crisantes rarely whiffs; he whiffed at pitches 18% of the time, which is an elite mark and portends to him being a plus hitter at maturity. His 86% in-zone contact rate is also another indicator of strong bat-to-ball skills. He has quick wrists and outstanding plate coverage, which allows him to attack pitches all over the zone. He is a patient hitter who works deep counts and is selective with what he swings at. The swing is simple, with a slight toe-tap and quick swing. It gets fairly linear sometimes; he sacrifices some power for contact by design. At second base, Crisantes is fringy there; he has never quite gotten his arm back after his TJ almost five years ago. But he projects out as a top-of-the-order hitter who makes well-above contact and gets on base at a well-above-average clip, and the power is more than enough not to be worried. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

The name of the game with Chandler Simpson is speed. He’s one of the most electric athletes in the minors, boasting 80-grade speed. Simpson is one of the twitchiest athletes I’ve ever seen, with the footspeed and baserunning know-how to be an absolute menace on the basepaths—you don’t steal 90+ bases in a season by accident. But he’s more than just a speedster; he’s not your typical Dassan Brown type. Simpson is a plus hitter and a plus defensive center fielder. His speed helps compensate for slightly suboptimal routes in center as he floats to batted balls. His reads are solid, but he’ll sometimes rely purely on his otherworldly speed. However, he’s cleaned that up with better pro instruction. His arm is below average, but it’s serviceable in center field—he routinely hits the cut-off man, though he won’t make any highlight-reel throws. Simpsons’ hit tool is a plus, as he’s posted elite zone-contact rates at every level. His swing is relatively linear, which fits perfectly into his game. He loves to get the bat out and flip low-line drives to all fields, and he has just enough power to make defenses respect him. Over-the-fence power is not part of his game, but his line-drive strength is enough to keep him dangerous. His bat path stays in the zone for a while, and he shows quick hands and plus bat speed. He doesn’t need to sell out for power, and his approach is patient—he works deep counts and rarely chases outside the zone. Consider Chandler Simpson as Jarrod Dyson+ but with a better hit tool. That, along with his defense and elite speed, gives him such a high floor as a big-league regular. The dream is that he becomes an old-school leadoff hitter who’s a massive asset on the basepaths. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

Michael Arroyo was part of what will end up being a loaded 2024 Modesto Nuts squad, and he might have been the most unheralded of the group going into the season; the same can’t be said exiting the season. He is a shorter, stockier second-base prospect known more for his glove than his defensive exploits. He is an easy plus hitter, hitting all the statistical and scouty benchmarks one would want for that lofty hit tool grade. He adjusts well to mid-plate appearance; you can see on camera and behind the plate that he recalibrates after every pitch. He shows good barrel manipulation and can attack pitches all over the zone. Like most smaller hitters, his strike zone isn’t very big, and his simple, quick swing with quick wrists allows him to pounce on pitches all over the zone. The power he showed this year was impressive, showing ample feel for back-spinning batted balls and taking balls to all fields. When I saw him a few times in person, I was blown away at how special his ability to manipulate batted ball events was; the infield was shifted ever so slightly, and he hit a ball the other way for a double that should have been a single. In the field, you will be disappointed if you expect anything more than the rudimentary plays. Arroyo has a stockier build and isn’t the most fluid athlete. His arm is OK, as he can make the throw to first base, and that is all you really need at second; he can cover the bag well enough but don’t expect him to be near the top half of any defensive metric. What Arroyo provides is what you want from a middle-infield prospect who can’t play shortstop; he can hit and provides a level of safety with his batted ball diet, with both quality and quantity in his batted ball events, and more than enough power to make you overlook the ball he just booted on the right side of the infield. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

Arjun Nimmala has the potential to be a power-hitting SS in the MLB, but it is likely hitting for average will never be a massive part of his game; he could stick at SS with his athleticism/arm, but depending on how his body continues to mature he may shift over to 3B. Nirmala has an athletic build with a frame that is getting close to being completely filled out, but he still has room to go; he moves well, possessing smooth movements and solid lateral quickness. He will likely slow down as his body matures. At the plate, Nimmala’s hands start slightly above his shoulders close to his body and move very little in his simple load; he has no leg kick and a small stride. Nimmala has strong wrists, allowing him to generate above-average bat speed, leading to some serious pop from his bat; when he connects with the ball, he consistently produces hard exit velocities above 100mph. Despite having some serious raw power, Nimmala has to improve his approach at the plate. His plate discipline and strikeouts are an issue for him and will most likely remain one for him throughout his career as he doesn’t have the greatest bat-to-ball skills; it will be crucial for him to improve his plate discipline/approach to put together competitive AB’s more consistently in the future. In the field, Nimmala has good instincts at SS and an above-average arm; he has solid range, and depending on how his body matures/slows down as he ages, he may shift to 3B. Still, his above-average arm and power first bat will allow him to profile well at the position. Nimmala must improve his plate discipline/approach to reduce his strikeout numbers and unlock more of his raw power. It will be vital for him to maintain his athleticism as his body matures. If not, he’ll most likely shift over to 3B; if he can improve his discipline/approach, he can be an above-average power-hitting IF in an MLB lineup. - Alex Kempton

Crawford is a disciplined hitter at the plate, even if he doesn't generate elite exit velocities. He recorded a 9.4% swinging strike rate across High-A and Double-A, showing his ability to make consistent contact. His in-zone contact rate was 82% in High-A and improved to 85% in Double-A, demonstrating his adaptability and feel for the strike zone. With a flat swing path, Crawford is effective at covering pitches throughout the zone, although his swing decisions can be mixed—he does chase occasionally but often manages to make contact on the edges. Crawford's elite speed is the cornerstone of his profile and paired with strong contact skills; he has a high floor as a near-MLB-ready player with a 50 OFP.

The former consensus #1 prospect before Jac Caglianone came to town, Mitchell had himself an excellent first season of pro ball. There were some concerns from Royals fans about taking a prep catcher with their top pick in the draft, but he has shown off the skills that had the Royals extremely interested in him at 8th overall. On the offensive side, it is obvious that the power is his standout tool. He’s got lightning-quick bat speed, and it’s a beautiful, smooth swing from the lefthanded side of the box. On top of his raw power, Mitchell has an excellent feel for the strike zone, posting walk rates at 17% in Low-A. The weakness for Mitchell at the plate is he strikes out too much. He posted a 30.5% strikeout rate. He possesses some concerns about his hit tool, but he hasn’t posted any horrible swinging strike rates, giving you some hope for the future. Behind the dish, Mitchell has an absolute cannon, as he used to touch 97 mph on the mound as a pitcher. He calls a good game for pitchers on the mound and has the leadership traits you’d want to see from your backstop. His arm and athleticism are good enough, but he could easily handle a corner outfield spot if he doesn’t stick behind the plate. But what we have seen behind the dish so far might not be a concern. The ceiling is sky-high for Mitchell with his plus power and double-plus arm. Going into his age-20 season, he will likely start his season in High-A, where he got a small sample size at the end of 2024. - Jared Perkins

Scouting Report

Freeland has continually improved ever since he went undrafted in the 2020 draft. A consistent improvement eventually led to a 3rd round selection and now is a potential shortstop to rely on. Offensively, Freeland is a well-rounded threat. He has solid bat to ball skills with a very good understanding of the strike zone that has steadily improved. The switch hitter has great bat speed from both sides of the plate and a knack for finding the barrel. He is better generally from the left side but has improved his contact ability from the right side. He has an approach geared towards spraying the ball to all fields, but also has a good ability to pull the ball in the air and gets to his power in-game. He has a strong upper body which translates to borderline plus raw power. On the basepaths he is a fringe-average runner but his instincts and good first step allow him to steal more bags than his top end speed would suggest. Defensively, Freeland’s range is bolstered by those very instincts. He has great hands and strong footwork that are plenty good enough to stick at shortstop, however he has experience at second and third. The arm is arguably his best tool, it is plus and he has shown an ability to throw from multiple planes. He has room to grow defensively but has a high enough floor to be a utility fielder at the major league level. Freeland’s scouting report cannot end without discussing his intangibles. He has been praised for his work ethic and instincts leading the well-rounded skill set to have a relatively high floor. - Adam Kiel

Scouting Report

A knee injury cut the 2024 season short for Josue Briceño, who collected only 176 plate appearances. He was assigned to the Arizona Fall League, where he shined to the tune of being the first-ever AFL triple-crown winner. Fitting that, he shares a hometown in Venezuela with former MLB triple-crown winner Miguel Cabrera. He starts slightly open with a slight bend in his knees and has a leg kick load mechanism. His carrying tool is his big power potential that comes from his big frame. He showed in the AFL that he’ll punish mistakes of any kind. During the 2024 season, he showed a penchant for lifting balls down in the zone. His power plays to all fields well, he can go with the pitch and still have the authority in his contact. He couples that with good strike zone knowledge, allowing him to draw walks. Still, his approach can get fairly aggressive. When that happens, he can struggle to make solid contact because he covers the zone pretty well. He has a good arm behind the plate but isn’t exceedingly athletic, so he probably winds up as a first baseman. That will put even more pressure on the bat to perform. Briceño’s performance in the AFL put a lot of helium around his name, and for good reason. It was incredible. However, realistically, he will need to continue to make good swing decisions that allow him to show off his power. If he winds up at first base, he will need to hit enough for the power to show through. He’s shown off the ability to do that successfully, he’ll look to reiterate it in 2025. - Trevor Hooth

Scouting Report

Morgan may not have the most enticing upside profile, but it’s really easy to see an everyday first baseman here. The hit tool carries the bat, mainly due to tremendous bat-to-ball skills. He owns great contact rates and it will continue to translate at the higher levels. The approach is solid but could use work with some chase tendencies, which is the only knock on his hit tool. He chases a bit too much and the bat-to-ball skills turn those chases into weak contact, so if the discipline could improve the bat will be even better. There’s not much power in this profile and there never has really been any signs of raw power, so it’s not something to expect long term. The dramatic hit over power in this fashion is unique for a first base profile, but the hit tool is enough for an average bat I think. In the field, he is a legitimate gold glove contender at first and playable in the corner of the outfield as well. I think he stays at first base long-term, partly since he is just so elite there and partly due to the arm not being that impressive. Again, it’s not highest ceiling and it’s hard to buy into first base profiles with little power, but the hit tool and defense give him a clear path to an everyday 1B. - Grant Carver

Scouting Report

Petty was one of the more highly touted amateur pitching prospects of the last few years, famously dialing it up to 102 mph with a hellacious slider. We’re now four years removed from his amateur days, and a lot has changed. Petty was traded to the Reds in the Sonny Gray deal, and while he isn’t hitting 102 with the fastball anymore, he still lives in the mid-90s and can reach back for more when he needs it. His four-seamer can touch 99 now and sits 95-97. He will also throw a sinker at 93-95. He went back to the four-seamer more in 2024 and as a result his velocity went back up again. It’s not a big bat missing pitch, but it's plenty good enough to setup the rest of the arsenal. His slider is his best pitch and it's a bullet-slider that he busts in on left-handers and uses as a chase pitch against right-handers. It also gets classified as a cutter due to the different variations. His changeup lacks movement but he sells it well. He throws a lot of strikes but far too often these pitches get too much of the zone. To their credit the Reds unleashed Petty a bit. They had strict limits on him in 2023 not allowing him to throw over 60 pitches in an outing but he threw a career high 137 innings last year, easily a career high for him. He even tossed seven innings in four of his last seven starts. There’s big stuff here but Petty’s fastball doesn’t miss as many bats as maybe it should because it lacks movement. There is enough here for Petty to be a useful fourth starter. There’s a chance he makes his debut at some point in 2025. - Matt Thompson

Scouting Report

The Mariners initially found Brody Hopkins out of Winthrop, one of the better D2 programs, and just over a year later, he was flipped to the Rays as part of the return for Randy Arozarena. Hopkins is still relatively fresh as a pitcher, having only focused full-time on the mound for about a year. Thanks to his drop-and-drive mechanics, he releases the ball from a low 5-foot release point and typically uses a three-quarters arm slot. However, he sometimes struggles to maintain his release point, which affects his command. He can get scattershot with his control and tends to overthrow, leading to glove-side misses. His fastball is his primary weapon, and he can tweak its shape depending on the situation. He features a four-seam version with around 15 inches of induced vertical break from his low release point, making it an effective chase pitch in the zone. He also uses a tailing two-seam fastball to left-handed hitters, inducing weak contact, and occasionally throws a cutter, though it’s the least optimal of his fastball variations. Hopkins pairs his fastball with a hard slider that has good horizontal movement. The slider’s axis can be inconsistent, sometimes showing hard downward movement and other times a glove-side sweep. Regardless of its shape, the slider works well off both types of fastballs, and he can get through a lineup twice using just his fastball-slider combo. His changeup, however, is inconsistent, and his feel for it comes and goes. He might benefit from adopting a downward off-speed pitch, like a Vulcan changeup or splitter. At the same time, his command needs refinement, which can be expected since he’s still learning the craft, unlike most prospects who have pitched their whole lives. With a relatively fresh arm and room to project, Hopkins is a solid mid-rotation starter, with the potential for more if his changeup takes a step forward. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

We waited a little longer than we would’ve hoped for Felnin Celesten to make his professional debut. Shortly after he signed with the Mariners for an organizational record $4.7 million in 2023, he injured his hamstring and was shelved for the year. He made his professional debut in 2024, but the Mariners brought him stateside and he jumped over the DSL entirely. All Celesten did was hit .352/.431/.568 out in Arizona and he chipped in three homers and five steals in 32 games. His season was delayed but then also cut short due to a broken hamate bone. When healthy Celesten has as much upside as almost anyone, but all the missed time is not ideal. Celesten has plus speed and plus power, and has shown strong plate skills, especially considering his experience level. Defensively, Celesten is very solid, and should stick at shortstop. He makes all the plays but contacts I’ve spoken with have mentioned that the routine plays sometimes are the biggest issue here, which isn’t unusual for a young player. The arm is plus also. Celesten’s ceiling is massive, its that of a franchise shortstop. He’s missed a lot of time in the early going due to injuries, but this is the type of guy who is all the sudden the top prospect in baseball in 18 months. The ceiling is much higher than a 50 OFP, but with the health concerns and him being so far away from the big leagues we are being conservative. Also the hamate injury is a concerning one for power, so I want to wait and see what that looks like. - Matt Thompson

Scouting Report

The Mariners drafted Edwin Arroyo in the second round in 2021 out of Puerto Rico, where he was a two-player capable of pitching left-handed, and sent him to the Reds in the Luis Castillo deal. Arroyo reached Double-A in 2023 and was likely going to return there in 2024 but a labrum injury that he suffered during spring training required surgery and he missed the entire season. He did make it back for about 80 plate appearances in the Arizona Fall League and looks good to go for the start of 2025. Arroyo’s plus shortstop defense is what will get him to the big leagues. His arm is plus with plenty of zip and carry and he has superb accuracy. He makes the routine plays and his range and instincts allow him to get to more balls than most and also convert them into outs. Offensively he’s a better hitter from the right side, showing more power, but his offensive game is built more so on hitting line drives all over the field and going gap-to-gap. He is also a good baserunner and will take the extra base when necessary. It’s doubtful he moves Elly De La Cruz off of shortstop but Arroyo has the skills to play anywhere on the infield. He’s likely going to Double-A to start 2025, and will need to be added to the 40-man roster following the season. - Matt Thompson

After spending two years as the catalyst of a Stanford lineup that went to Omaha twice, Montgomery ventured closer to home. He attended Texas A&M, putting together a fantastic campaign before a leg injury took him out for the year. As a result, Montgomery did not make his professional debut in 2024, though he should be clear by spring training. Montgomery’s overall approach got better in College Station, and while it’s a power-over-hit profile, Montgomery has solid bat-to-ball skills from the left side and pummels the baseball to all fields, displaying plus power with exit velocities up to 116 MPH and elite barrel feel. He’s a switch-hitter for now, but Montgomery will likely need to be a left-handed bat at some point. The only wart in his swing from the left side is his trouble with change-ups, as he handles velocity and spins well from this side. Montgomery’s bat path is inconsistent as a right-handed hitter, and there are many swing-and-miss concerns. Making the move to ditch the switch-hitting will improve the grade on the hit tool, though for now, we’ll stick with average. Montgomery is a right-fielder at the next level in the field. His route-running can get inconsistent, but his double-plus arm fits the position well with accuracy and pure arm strength. He’s an average runner, though it’ll be worth keeping an eye on this once he returns from injury. Montgomery was a top-ten player in this class and has immense upside. - Tyler Jennings

Scouting Report

The Guardians’ selection of Chase DeLauter is still seen as a draft-day steal, but his pro career has been marked by one recurring issue: persistent injuries. He first injured his foot in college, which made him available for the Guardians later in the first round, and since turning pro, he’s had four stints on the Injured List for various issues. When healthy, DeLauter stands out as one of the best left-handed power hitters in the minors, though the lingering injury risk is a constant concern. Physically, DeLauter is an imposing athlete with well-distributed muscle across his frame. He has elite bat speed and raw strength, which produces impressive power paired with a natural loft in his swing. His swing decisions are strong overall, with his bat staying through the zone for a long time, allowing for excellent plate coverage. In Double-A, he recorded a 90% in-zone contact rate—a plus-plus figure—and a 14.7% whiff rate. Occasionally, he does chase out of the zone, but it’s not to an alarming extent. His swing enables him to drive the ball with authority to all fields, and he already shows an advanced feel for lifting and pulling batted balls. Defensively, DeLauter’s slightly stiff movements have led him to a corner outfield position, where he projects as an above-average defender. He takes good routes and demonstrates a strong sense of how to handle slicing line drives. His arm is a plus tool, which will only add to his value in a corner role. Without the injury setbacks, DeLauter might have debuted in 2024 and even graduated from prospect status. As it stands, he’s on the doorstep of the majors and could make his debut early in 2025, potentially establishing himself as the Guardians’ everyday right fielder and a fixture in the middle of their lineup. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

Del Castillo was a highly regarded prospect while at the University of Miami and he was, for a brief time anyways, in the conversation to go off the board near the top of the draft. He wasn’t nearly as productive in his second go around and slipped to the 67th overall pick. His stock took a nosedive and he wasn’t considered much of a prospect until he put up a nice 2023 season in Double-A. The real breakout came in 2024 as he was one of the best hitters in all of Triple-A, hitting .312/.399/.603 and getting a call up to the major league squad. He more than held his own in his 25 game sample in the big leagues, but it was his improvement on defense that stood out. He’s still a fringy defender there but that is a massive upgrade and, combined with his offense, its enough to be a second division regular behind the dish. I think there’s even more in the tank offensively though as he has more power than he has shown. The rare catcher that can smack 25 homers if given the lead role. With Gabriel Moreno around Del Castillo figures to be an offensive first backup and part-time DH because his bat is good enough to try and get in the lineup nearly everyday. There’s good on-base skills here also to go along with the power. - Matt Thompson

Scouting Report

The Pirates drafted the former Campbell Camel with the 36th overall pick in the 2022 draft. Harrington was a college arm with projection as he was relatively new to pitching and the Pirates gambled that their pitching development could get Harrington to the big leagues. As we enter 2025 Harrington is knocking on the door with 46 innings at Triple-A under his belt and a strong minor league track record of success. He has a deep, five pitch arsenal which he commands extremely well, and his overall command is plus-plus. He walked just over 4% of all hitters last season which was one of the best rates in the minor leagues amongst starters. Harrington has a deep arsenal led by his new four-seamer. He went more to the four-seamer instead of the two-seamer and it has resulted in even better command. His slider is his best secondary pitch and he was able to add sweep to the pitch last season. His curveball and cutter are both average offerings and he also unveiled a new splitter last season by altering his changeup grip and it has shown to be at least an average or better pitch despite its infancy. Harrington doesn’t miss a ton of bats but gets results due to his command and deep arsenal. He did miss the first month of the season last year due to a rotator cuff strain, but finished strong and looked healthy when he returned. Harrington lacks the ceiling of some of the more recent Pirates arms but his floor for a pitching prospect is nearly unmatched. The ability to command and sequence makes him a backend big league starter, and if he can somehow add some velocity to his 92-93 MPH fastball we might really have something here. Harrington will make his big league debut sometime in 2025. - Matt Thompson

Scouting Report

The Mariners have handled Harry Ford very slowly, and that has been to the benefit of both him and the organization. Harry Ford is one of the better athletes you will see at any given point when you watch a game. He is an easy plus runner on the basepaths when he is healthy. He is athletic enough that I would like to see him be more aggressive on the basepaths than he already is, and I would like to see him get some run on the infield. Ford has made strides as a catcher, is a good framer, and blocks balls well in the dirt. He has come a long way since being considered a novelty as a catcher because of his athleticism, and he has become someone who projects out as a league-average defender at catcher. He handles a staff well and shows all the intangible bits you want from a catcher, as he will go out there and calm a pitcher down or go out there and cheer them on after a long inning. Great Britain's starting catcher as a hitter is a patient, teetering on passive, who is more of a line-drive contact hitter. He works himself into decent counts and looks to spray balls. He gets too opposite-field heavy, and when he pulls a ball, it dies down at the warning tracks. The power has taken a step back from what it was in 2023, which is concerning. With diminished power, it is nice that the catching skills have rounded up. If Harry Ford can get on base, be a menace on the basepaths with good base stealing instincts while playing catcher, he has a chance to be a valuable 1B to Cal Raleigh’s 1A and form one of the game’s more interesting catching tandems in 2026, albeit both of them contributing to the game in completely different ways. - Rhys White

Owen Caissie is one of the best young Canadian prospects in the game, and this time last year, there were some whispers about him being a potential platoon bat, but he worked on his pitch recognition against left-handed pitchers and now looks like a viable everyday offering. Caissie’s calling card is his plus power, which he generates because of his raw strength, bat speed, and some natural loft in his swing. He does have some issues with his swing-path and the amount of contact that results from it. There is a large position in the strike zone that Owen Caissie will struggle to make contact with. Caissie does have some aggressive tendencies and is looking to do damage with pitches all over the zone, but he can struggle to get to pitches because of the loft in his swing. He does offset some of his swing-and-miss with an ability to draw a walk at an above-average rate because of decent strike-zone recognition. Caissie can be a 30-homer bat during his peak years, where all the batted-ball variance is going for him. He is your classic corner outfielder in the field with a good arm. His plus arm is a real weapon in the outfield, as his arm strength is both plus, and his throws are accurate. Caissie is one of the higher variance prospects because of some aggressive swing-and-miss issues, but he is on the 40-man and should be up early in the season. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

C.J. Kayfus is a Guardians success story. During his time at the University of Miami, he was more of a contact-oriented first baseman at The U. Kayfus is a fully formed ball of clay physically, as there is no additional room to add physicality. He’s a bit on the shorter side for a first baseman, but that’s fine—he’s a good enough defender. He doesn’t boot many batted balls or present himself as a bad target. You don’t notice him in the field, which can be good or bad, depending on how one feels about first-base defense. He occasionally runs out into the outfield and looks solid enough to fake it in left field, but the range isn’t impressive, and he doesn’t possess exceptional reads. Like most corner infielders, the batter’s box is where most of his value will be tied up. Kayfus has such a high floor as an offensive prospect because everything starts with his swing decisions. He is a plus hitter with a good approach and a strong understanding of the strike zone. He chases at well-below-league-average rates while making good swing decisions in the zone. He has more than enough plate coverage to attack pitches away from him, and he has shown an ability to lift and pull, which allows him to access the impressive power that he played down as an amateur. His swing shows the right amount of barrel malleability, enabling him to attack pitches all over the strike zone. The power is impressive, as Kayfus routinely barrels balls over 110 MPH, paired with enough loft to allow that power to play in games. The ceiling with the power is very high—think 30-homer seasons—and he pairs that power with good swing decisions. There’s a chance he takes another step forward, but the Guardians may have already gotten all the juice out of this fruit, so to speak. He projects as a middle-of-the-order bat who is good enough at first or left field that a team like Cleveland will have no problem rolling him out there in his cheap pre-arb years. Then, they might look to move him on when the arbitration bill comes due. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

Dana is proving to be one of the better stories out of the Angels farm system in quite some time. Making him a way overslot 11th rounder is looking like a great draft maneuver, and he should be a part of the next Angels core. He looks the part of a durable long term starter, with a big build and lots of strength. The fastball is above average and his command of it is a big reason why. He is good at getting the fastball to where it needs to be and the body type leaves hope that he still has some velocity ticks he can add to it. It didn't play very well in his short debut in 2024, but it should be better than that long term. The slider is his best pitch and is a definite plus offering. It’s his favorite swing and miss offering and he can get it in the zone enough to where he throws it for strikes consistently as well. The curveball is solid, but he leaves it over the plate for damage a bit too much and it doesn't look like a putaway pitch for now. The changeup is in the same boat, although it has flashed to be above average at times and it’s easy to project that one improving. It’s the one pitch that he does not locate very well on, but if he ever gets consistent there it might be his third best pitch. The arsenal is deep and makes him a no doubt starter in my book. Combine it with the durability he’s shown and the consistent improvements on his end, and you’re looking at a guy who could be a mid rotation starter for a long time. - Grant Carver

Scouting Report

Catching is one of the Royals system's strong suites, and that is in large part because of Carter Jensen. He has long been a power-oriented prospect, with questions about both the hit tool and defense, but both have shown enough improvement to put him near the top of the system. He will always carry a high swing-and-miss percentage, but the hit tool is not as big of a red flag as it once was. He has a solid, patient approach and is almost too picky up there, running low zone swing rates and impressively low chase numbers. It'll be interesting to see how that plays as he gets higher in the minors, but right now, the approach helps balance out some swing-and-miss concerns. Of course, we all know he has above-average power, and he gets to it plenty, thanks to his quick swing and size. The power plays and could even get in the plus range if he can translate it to games a bit more. Behind the plate, Jensen is still not known for his receiving skills but has drawn praise for improvements. His above-average arm will help him stick behind the plate if he can be close to an average receiver. And if he stays as a catcher, the bat has enough impact potential for him to be a key figure in the future of the Royals. All signs point to him trending in the right direction. - Grant Carver

The Diamondbacks selected Ryan Waldschmidt out of the University of Kentucky with the Prospect Promotion Incentive pick they received after Corbin Carroll won the Rookie of the Year award. He started his college career at Charleston Southern before transferring to the University of Kentucky. He tore his ACL in his left knee while down at the cape but remarkably made it back and absolutely raked. He hit .335/.465/.613 in his draft year but injury concerns dropped him down to the 31st pick. Waldschmidt is a corner outfielder with above-average speed, but he lacks the first step quickness to stick in center for anything longer than a short stint. Offensively Waldschmidt had one of the better hit tools in the college class and it was backed up by good swing decisions and limited chase. He’s a little stiff offensively but he can catch up to velocity and has no issues hitting the ball in the air consistently. He’s a grinder that keeps his head down and plays hard, getting the most out of his tools. Waldschmidt has one of the highest floors in the draft, and he projects as an everyday left fielder, possibly as soon as 2026. - Matt Thompson

Melton has a strong athletic frame that makes him look like a more traditional corner player. Melton’s setup strongly resembles Kyle Tucker’s between his slight knee bend and slightly closed stance with a similar hand and bat placement. While Melton doesn’t have the same ultra smooth and efficient swing as his former organization-mate, Melton does have a powerful swing. Melton coils in his load quite aggressively, getting his hands deep behind his body and creating a bit of a lumberjack bat path. The result is big time impact though also inconsistent and typically low launch angles and some swing and miss. Melton is also on the aggressive side, especially when picking up secondaries. Melton is close to a below average hit tool grade but with his plus raw power and consistent impact in game means his overall contact quality is too good to justify the 40-grade. The hitting deficiencies will likely hold Melton back from being a 25 home run hitter. Despite the size of his build, Melton is one of the best overall athletes in the minor leagues with easy plus run times; he maximizes the speed in game and is an above average base stealer. The speed allows Melton to play comfortably average in center field and he typically looks above average up the middle defensively with plus potential if he’s ever forced into a corner. Melton has above average arm strength that would make him an excellent corner outfielder, though it can provide value in center, as well. Melton lacks polish on the offensive end with an unorthodox swing and aggressive approach, though he checks a ton of other boxes from a physical perspective and could become an impact everyday player even with an inconsistent hit tool. - Tyler Paddor

Scouting Report

Montes is a prospect of extremes, and if it all clicks, we could be talking about one of the more exciting young power bats in the minors. Montes is a physically imposing athlete, and while standing near him, I wondered if we were from the same species. He has good muscle all over his body and looks the part. He has some parts of his game that need some massive refinement. He is an aggressive swinger and struggles with breaking ball recognition. He gets sequenced to death by the most advanced pitchers he saw in 2024. He gets aggressive in and out of the zone. There is some feel for taking walks as he will get a touch more selective late in counts. The contact part of his game is below average, but it can go very far when he makes contact. Even when he is late, he can smash a pitch the other way. The power carries the profile, as he could be a middle-of-the-order bat if he cuts down a touch on the aggressiveness because of the quality of contact; when he makes contact, it is loud. In the outfield, he looks helpless at points, gets mixed up on his routes, and there is a ton of effort, resulting in him looking like he is doing something and giving the illusion he is a good defender. But when you watch him, his footwork is sloppy, and he doesn’t charge in on balls in a corner well. He has a bazooka attached to his arm, which helps cover up some issues, but even the accuracy of his throws can be erratic. He needs to hit his cut-off man more consistently. What if you had two 70s and a bunch of 40s? His game has a high variance, which may indicate his bright peak, but the lows will be really low. Think along the lines of Franmil Reyes if you are a comparison person. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

Robert Calaz is the talk of the town, like a new restaurant that pops up in a trendy neighborhood. There is a lot to like about Robert Calaz; he hits the ball extremely hard and puts up the statistical benchmarks one would want to be considered a top 100 prospect. He destroyed the Arizona Complex League and did so in such a fashion you wonder why the prototypical right-field build was left there all season. He has a smooth and compact swing, with some present feel for loft, but is more linear in its movements. He sometimes gets a touch passive, more interested in working deeper counts than pouncing on pitches early in the count that allows his plus raw power to play in games. Some slight breaking ball issues, especially down in the zone, haven’t become massive red flags yet. He struggled chasing hard vertical breaking pitches, sliders, curveballs, and splitters out of the zone. But he shows good strike-zone recognition on the east-west portion of the zone. Calaz is not going to be a center-fielder for very long; his routes out there are limited because of below-average footspeed, luckily in a corner, these issues are mitigated, where he can be a solid option in right or left because of his above-average arm. Calaz is not quite the power and speed threat people want him to be, but the makings of a good approach, with present power, give us hope that he can work on some strike-zone issues low in the low and he can become a reliable middle of the order type bat during his peak years that gets the usual bump from playing in Coors Field. - Rhys White

Scouting Report

Agustin Ramírez has had a slow burn through the minors, and just as he was breaking out, the Yankees sent him off in a package for Jazz Chisholm. Ramírez's value lies heavily in his bat, especially his power. He sells out for it but pairs that with enough of an approach to manage the strikeouts. He's patient at times, waiting for pitches he can really drive. There's a legit chance he could be a 30-homer bat at the highest level, thanks to how easily he taps into that power. Of course, with catchers, there's always the caveat of durability. The swing has natural loft, though he flattens it out occasionally. This hints at him potentially being an above-average hitter—especially if we factor in his position and grade on a curve—but we'd like to see more consistency before entirely buying into his hit tool. Defensively, he's a mixed bag. He's a poor receiver but reportedly calls a decent game and is improving as a blocker. Still, he's below average overall because of his receiving struggles. With the upcoming challenge system, that may matter less. His arm is plus behind the plate, helping his case as a viable catcher. The Marlins, nowhere near contention, can afford the time to see if he sticks there. He can still become a power-hitting first baseman with double-plus juice in the tank if he doesn't. Luckily, we will see Ramírez very early because he was in Triple-A for a large chunk of last year. - Rhys White
