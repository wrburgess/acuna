BA Grade/Risk: 75/High.

The Skinny: The star of the offseason, Sasaki inked with the Dodgers and immediately added yet another star into the Chavez Ravine supernova. The 23-year-old isn’t a finished product, but he has the upside of a true ace with the right coats of polish.

The Skinny: Anthony’s breakout began in 2023 and continued through 2024, when he blitzed the upper levels and vaulted himself into the highest prospect tier. His contact, plate discipline and power should give him all the ingredients to become a regular in Boston’s lineup by the end of the 2025 season.

The Skinny: After injuries marred the early portion of his career, Jobe emerged in full in 2024. Tigers fans got a taste of their top prospect toward the end of the season and in the playoffs, but he’ll get his first long-term exposure this coming season. He has a chance to pitch toward the top of Detroit’s rotation.

The Skinny: Jenkins was one of the most celebrated prospects as an amateur and still shows a tremendously high ceiling, albeit after a year hamstrung by injuries. He has the upside of a five-tool player, especially if he can add a bit more impact to his contact as he grows into his body.

The Skinny: The Nationals’ top prospect and the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 draft reached the majors in 2024 and showed flashes of his potential. He hasn’t dominated the upper levels or the majors quite yet, but he’s still got plenty of time and the tool set to make an impact in D.C.

The Skinny: After a down season in his draft year at Tennessee, Dollander fell to the Rockies, who were all too happy to pounce. The righthander rewarded their faith by tearing through the minor leagues in his pro debut and establishing himself as one of the game’s top arm talents. The next test might be Coors Field.

He returned in the Arizona Fall League and showed shockingly little rust as he dominated some of the game’s brightest prospects over the course of six short starts. He has a chance to reach Philadelphia in 2025.

The next step will be going deeper into games. He hasn’t pitched past the fourth inning in any of his 16 professional starts.

The Skinny: Williams has long earned a rep as a defensive wizard. In 2024, he broke out in the batter’s box with a big-time season in the notoriously pitcher-friendly Southern League. He was one of just eight minor league shortstops to reach the 20-homer plateau and was the only one of the group to swipe 30 or more bags.

The Skinny: Eldridge is one of the biggest position players in the minors, and his power lives up to every expectation foretold by his 6-foot-7, 225-pound frame. No longer a two-way player, Eldridge has focused on being one of the best young power prospects in the game.

The Skinny: Lawlar was supposed to establish himself as a key piece of Arizona’s lineup in 2024. Instead, he spent most of the year battling injuries and accumulated just 85 at-bats. He’ll look to push the reset button in 2025 and begin to show the well-balanced skill set that could lead to a big role in the D-backs’ uprising.

The Skinny: Basallo is the game’s top catching prospect thanks to monster upside in the batter’s box and an outstanding throwing arm behind the dish. Adley Rutschman’s presence in Baltimore lessens the pressure on Basallo to stick at catcher, but his offensive ceiling should make him a valuable part of the Orioles’ lineup for years to come. He should debut in 2025.

The Skinny: Injuries limited Mayer’s season to just 77 games at Double-A Portland, but when he was on the field he showed strong hittability and on-base skills with hints of power mixed in along the way. He’s likely to begin in Triple-A in 2025. If he can stick at shortstop, he’ll help Roman Anthony and Kristian Campbell form a huge piece of Boston’s coming core.

He dealt with injuries in 2024 but showed plenty of flashes of his potential in a year split between the Class A levels. He’s one of the purest hitters in Seattle’s system. If he can add more power, he’ll move into the game’s upper echelon.

The Skinny: Made was easily the best prospect in the Dominican Summer League in 2024, when he produced a 1.013 OPS with 21 extra-base hits in his first pro season. He showed contact and impact uncommon for a player his age and should be the latest piece of Milwaukee’s system to skip the Arizona Complex League and head straight to Low-A.

The Skinny: A year after Ethan Salas jumped from international free agency to Low-A, De Vries followed suit. He debuted in the California League and clubbed 11 home runs in 75 games. The total could have been higher if not for a shoulder injury that limited his exposure in the second half. He made up for lost time in the Arizona Fall League, where he became the youngest player to hit a home run since Bryce Harper.

The Skinny: Rodriguez has plenty of high-end tools and a nearly unparalleled ceiling if everything clicks. He knows the strike zone better than most umpires and hits the ball extraordinarily hard, but can be beaten by quality pitches in the strike zone and runs high strikeout rates as a result. His offensive game will profile at any spot in the outfield, especially if he can improve his zone-contact rate.

The Skinny: In 2023, before he had Tommy John surgery, Rocker was annihilating the competition at High-A Hickory. Once he returned, he picked up right where he left off. The Vanderbilt alum cruised through the upper levels on the way to his big league debut and has the stuff to pitch in the middle of a big league rotation. Innings management will be key in 2025, especially considering his checkered medical history.

There are hit tool questions and he’s not a sure bet to stick at shortstop, but Walcott’s dazzling array of tools, athleticism and upside hint at future starpower if it comes together.

The Skinny: The No. 1 pick in 2024 has exceptional bat-to-ball skills, an advanced approach and a swing optimized to get the most out of his above-average power. Bazzana needs to answer questions defensively, namely with his arm strength and accuracy, but he could settle in as Cleveland’s long-term second baseman sooner rather than later.

The Skinny: Scouts lauded Wetherholt’s pure hitting ability at West Virginia and his advanced plate skills held up in his foray into pro ball. Even better? Wetherholt showed above-average power and the Cardinals think he has a chance to stick at shortstop. If he does, he has all-star potential.

The Skinny: Lowder doesn’t overwhelm hitters. Instead, he works with precise craftsmanship. Few minor league pitchers matched Lowder’s double-plus control or ability to fill up the zone in 2024. His lack of a true putaway pitch limits his ceiling to a midrotation starter, but he has already reached the majors and should settle into Cincinnati in short order.

Burns has No. 2 starter upside if his control and command hold up in pro ball. He’ll make his pro debut in 2025 and could move quickly.

The Skinny: Rushing’s blend of power, plate discipline and improved contact helped him become one of the more productive hitters in the upper minors in 2024. While he’s reliable behind the plate, his athleticism and speed may push him to left field or first base. His bat should impact the Dodgers’ lineup at some point in 2025.

Don’t expect the same power upside as his brother, though Chourio’s upside could rival anyone in Cleveland’s system if he unlocks a bit more thump.

Genao was one of the most productive hitters in the lower minors in 2024. He’s ready for Double-A, where further development of his defense and in-game power is required.

Some question whether his ultra-aggressive approach will hold up against big league pitching. Still, his bat-to-ball skills are nearly unmatched and he’s a sturdy defender expected to settle into the Athletics’ starting role in 2025.

Montgomery maintained an intriguing blend of lefthanded power and patience, though his size heightens the risk he moves to third base as he enters his age-23 season.

The Skinny: No Dodgers prospect made a bigger stride than Freeland in 2024. The switch-hitting shortstop rose three levels to Triple-A and plays with a confidence that endears him to scouts. Oh, and he’s an above-average hitter with solid power and a strong arm.

The Skinny: Plus power and advanced swing decisions are De Paula’s calling cards. The powerfully-built, lefthanded-hitting Dominican corner outfielder has middle-of-the-order lineup upside, but it might have to be at DH unless he dramatically improves his defensive effort and quality.

The Skinny: The Guardians’ 2022 first-rounder offers plenty of production per capita, but availability has been an issue. DeLauter has played 96 games in three pro seasons, missing time with recurring foot injuries—which date back to his college days at James Madison—and introduces risk to a strong hitting foundation.

The Skinny: From fifth round of the 2023 draft to a top breakout pitching prospect of 2024, Rosario led all minor league starters with 33.1 K-BB%. Control is his strongest attribute, but his mid-90s fastball and revitalized splitter both have plus potential.

The Skinny: The Brewers went more than $1 million over slot to sign Pratt in the sixth round in 2023. A year later, the former Mississippi prep shined at a pair of Class A levels with a strong hitting foundation and a solid glove at shortstop. Look for Pratt to add power as his body and approach mature.

The lefthanded-hitting catcher broke out again at the upper levels in 2024, hitting for power and getting on base while refining his framing. His booming home run at the Futures Game was a highlight.

In the second half, he leaned into his bat-to-ball skills and hit .329 in his final 45 games. HIs table-setting profile and quality glove could earn him a look to play second base in Seattle at some point in 2025.

The Skinny: Baseball America’s High School Player of the Year shined as a shortstop and righthander at his Mississippi high school. Drafted ninth overall in 2024, Griffin has raw tools that few players can match, and if he can overcome hit tool concerns he has superstar potential with 30-homer, 30-steal upside.

When healthy, he showcased a table-setter profile with on-base skills, plus speed and solid power. He should stick up the middle, but probably more at second base or center field.

His promising three-pitch mix made short work of Carolina League opponents, especially in the playoffs where he struck out 18 and walked one in 10 shutout innings.

The Skinny: A legitimate pro prospect as both a hitter and pitcher, Rainer refined his hit tool as a high school senior to set him up to be the 11th pick in the 2024 draft. The lefthanded-hitting shortstop’s big raw power and arm strength give him the inside track on becoming the Tigers’ shortstop of the future.

The Skinny: Sproat cruised to Triple-A last year with dominating stints at High-A and Double-A. Triple-A gave him a chance to build his to-do list as he needs to hit his spots better, but his mid-90s fastball, changeup and slider are all MLB quality if he can spot them better.
