Sasaki also fits with some of the top pitching prospects on the last few versions of this list in terms of potential and polish. At his best, he can sit in the upper-90s and get into the triple digits, mixing in one of the best splitters on Earth and a plus slider, along with solid strike throwing and a starter-looking delivery. On Sasaki's best day, some scouts say he has two 80-grade pitches.

What the Japanese ace brings to the Dodgers 58dKiley McDaniel There are still a number of questions to answer and potential adjustments to make, though. Remember Paul Skenes learned his splinker, now his best pitch, after he was the top pick in the MLB draft. Likewise, Sasaki also needs to develop a bit more to become a major league ace.  Sasaki's velocity and fastball shape regressed a bit in 2024, as did his slider velocity; these both seem addressable with grip, intent and mechanical tweaks from a strong developmental organization. These issues, their cause and the solution were a big topic in presentations teams made and what Sasaki seemed most interested in.  His command (hitting specific spots) is just OK right now, but his level of control (simply throwing it over the plate) goes a long way, including in the best pro league other than MLB, because his stuff is so good. Sasaki could stand to add a cutter and/or a curveball to his arsenal to offer different looks. That's a long list of nitpicks, but don't get it twisted: Sasaki could be an ace by the end of this season if he makes quick adjustments.  play 0:17 Roki Sasaki puts on his Dodgers uniform for first timeRoki Sasaki dons his Dodgers jersey for the first time during his introductory news conference.",60/70,,,,,,,,,
1,2,Roman,Anthony,RF,Age: 20 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right,Left-Right,60,"Reminds me of: Somewhere on the spectrum from Colton Cowser to Kyle Tucker  Type: Lefty-hitting outfielder who is above average at everything and could hit 30-plus bombs  Anthony was a well-known prep prospect who had a rough summer showcase season then emerged as a top-two-rounds prospect with a strong senior spring in 2022. The Red Sox landed him with the last pick of the second round (No. 79 overall), but paid him late-first-round money with a $2.5 million bonus. The main questions at that point were his hit tool and overall offensive impact given that he was a likely corner outfielder.  Anthony was then one of the handful of prospects we get every draft who immediately looks notably better than expected in pro ball. He's probably still a right fielder, but he has improved athletically to where he can also play a solid center field. His bat-to-ball ability, exit velos and pitch selection were all notably better than expected right after he signed and have stayed that way during his rise through the minors.  There's legitimate star potential here with the plus-plus raw power to potentially hit 30 homers, above average on-base skills, and the speed, arm and instincts for real baserunning and defensive value. That was the sales pitch for Kyle Tucker at this point in his career, though Anthony has less bat-to-ball ability, more raw power and more speed than Tucker did at this point.",,,,,,45/55,65/70,55/50,45/55,55/55
2,3,Walker,Jenkins,RF,Age: 19 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right,Left-Right,60,"Reminds me of: J.D. Drew  Type: Smooth lefty hitter with incredible feel to hit along with above-average power and athleticism  I first closely scouted Jenkins in the summer between his sophomore and junior year of high school and immediately wrote ""J.D. Drew?"" in my notes because of his sweet swing, advanced hit tool and power/speed combo. Luckily, that report has held up 3Â½ years later. In the interim, Jenkins went fifth overall in one of the most loaded drafts of this century and now has jumped past Dylan Crews and Max Clark, who were drafted ahead of him.  Jenkins' selling point is his plus-plus bat-to-ball skills, which is helped by his efficient swing, but that also maximizes his raw power, giving him 25ish-homer upside as well. He's a fine runner with good instincts who is mostly playing center field now and will be an option there, but will likely slide to a corner spot in the big leagues. This wide base of skills and long track record makes Jenkins one of the safer and highest-probability regular among teenage prospects in recent memory; he would've been the top overall pick in many drafts and should be the top prospect in baseball in the next 12 months.",,,,,,50/65,50/60,50/45,45/55,50/50
3,4,Marcelo,Mayer,SS,Age: 22 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right,Left-Right,60,"Reminds me of: Lankier, lefty-hitting Willy Adames if it all clicks  Type: Smooth-handed and sweet-swinging shortstop with 25- to 30-homer upside  Mayer had long been hyped as a potential top pick since early in his high school career, and he delivered on that, going fourth overall in the 2021 draft out of a Southern California high school. His pro career through 2023 was more good than great, relative to those weighty expectations. The 2024 season was a step forward, with scouts reporting that he had more life to his game physically, with better run times, better range on defense and looser movements.  He also ticked up across the board in more measurable ways: his chase rate was down 3%, his swing rate was down 3%, his max exit velo was up 3 mph, his high-end exit velos jumped a tick even adjusting for natural progression, while his line drive and hard-hit rate spiked. Mayer's homer totals aren't as strong as his raw power grades because he doesn't lift and pull the ball as much as is theoretically ideal for his power. There will be push-pull mechanical and approach decisions to make in his career in terms of lift, raw power, contact and patience -- and that has all been playing out in the minors, as well.  Mayer is a strong defender who grades as an average defensive shortstop even without flashy range, foot speed or arm strength. He projects as a potential All-Star who posts above-average on-base percentages and hits 20-25 homers while playing shortstop. His short-term big league fit looks to be second base in the second half of 2025 if everything goes to plan, eventually becoming double-play partners with fellow highly touted prospect Kristian Campbell.",,,,,,40/50,60/65,45/40,45/50,55/55
4,5,Carson,Williams,SS,,Right-Right,60,"Reminds me of: Early-career Trevor Story or later-career Dansby Swanson  Type: Power-over-hit shortstop with Gold Glove potential  I think there's a tier break after the first five to seven on this list, and Williams fits near the back of that group because the swing-and-miss inherent in his game could undermine his offensive profile. That said, he's in this group because he's at least above average at everything else on the field while being a plus-plus defender and thrower at shortstop. This provides a high floor as a low-end regular or premium utility guy.  Williams was a hit-over-power prospect whom I compared to early-career Dansby Swanson as a Southern California high schooler in the 2021 MLB draft class. Williams also sat in the mid-90s on the mound but wasn't interested in pitching as a professional. After signing, he immediately put on muscle and started leaning into that newfound power offensively while not losing his defensive prowess or speed.  Given the Rays' history, I would expect Williams to dial in his offensive approach in Triple-A for most or all of 2025 to set him up for a full big league debut in 2026 while Taylor Walls and/or Jose Caballero hold down the position until Williams is deemed ready.",,,,,,30/40,55/60,55/55,60/65,70/70
5,6,Dylan,Crews,CF,Age: 22 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right,Right-Right,60,"Reminds me of: Starling Marte  Type: Plus power/speed combo in center field, but offensive outlook isn't totally clear yet  MLB Prospect Rankings: Terms To Know For the top tier of prospects, I present their tools as 45/60 meaning presently it's a 45 and projects to a 60 at maturity. 50 is major league average (which is a really good present tool for a minor leaguer), 55 is above average, 45 is below average, 60 is called plus (one standard deviation above average), 70 is plus-plus (two standard deviations), and 80 (three) is the top of the 20-80 scale, where just a handful of players in the big leagues reside.  These tools also scale to commonly used numbers. For game power, 50 equates to 15-18 homers per year, 55 is 19-22, 60 is about 25, 65 is about 30, etc. while run grades equate to specific times on a stopwatch, a 50 hit tool is about a .260 batting average, average fastball velocity is 92-93 depending on your role and handedness, and so on.  Other tools like throwing for position players or off-speed pitches are more based on visual evaluations, but there are some objective figures to round observations up or down.  This 20-80 scale also applies to the FV (future value) used to sum up a player's overall value. A 50 PV (present value) is a 2.0 to 2.5 WAR player. FV of a prospect who is big league ready maps to this pretty well: the top tier (65 FV this year) of prospects are projected to have multiple peak seasons of 4-to-5 WAR while the MVP winner is usually around 7-8 WAR.  The further down in the minors you go, it becomes a tiered system of ranking prospects based on their trade value relative to top-tier prospects.  To give further context, I've also included some categories along with tool grades. First, ""type,"" which categorizes a player for comparison among other players. I tend to round up on certain types (plus tools, plus makeup, middling stats) and round down on others (now velocity, teenaged right-handers).  The second is ""reminds me of."" This isn't a true comparison, because most players don't have a one-for-one perfect analog. There's also a lot of uncertainty with prospects, so it's by default looking at the rosier potential outcomes compared to some current MLB players. Its intent is to explain a player's ranking in a handful of simple words by saying they remind me of a current All-Star and have that as their high-risk upside, but you can also see why a lower-risk player might rank higher.  Crews was the best player in the 2020 prep class early in his high school career but had a tough final summer, then his senior spring was cut short by the pandemic so he had to decide between heading to LSU or taking late-first-to-compensation-round money to turn pro. He chose correctly, raking at LSU for three years, winning a national title, then going No. 2 in the 2023 draft behind teammate Paul Skenes.  As he has been under the microscope for years, scouts have been picking holes in Crews' game, and it took until he reached the upper minor leagues for some of those issues to appear. Like some other players in the top 10, Crews will probably have to choose if he wants to lean into contact and on-base skills or power, as he probably won't consistently be plus at both. I think he'll choose power.  Crews has some trouble with fastballs at the top of the strike zone, which are the easiest pitches to hit in the air for damage and also incredibly common to see in general, so while his raw power is plus, his game power plays a bit below that right now. There could be a mechanical adjustment to pull and lift and backspin that pitch more often (at the expense of other pitches), whereas now there are a few too many ground balls and opposite field flyouts for the current version of Crews to reach his 25-30 homer potential in the big leagues. If he gets to his power upside, I'd expect his hit tool and on-base skills to fall to average or a bit below.  That said, he has a plus raw power/speed combo, plays a good center field and has a solid feel for contact and the strike zone. He could be an adjustment or two from being a perennial All-Star. Or he could come in around where my tool grades have him projected and be a good everyday player posting 2.5- to 3.5-win seasons most years.",,,,,,45/50,55/60,60/60,45/50,55/55
6,7,Jackson,Jobe,RHP,Age: 22 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right,Right-Right,60,"Reminds me of: 2019 Walker Buehler, but with a better changeup  Type: Medium-framed velo/spin merchant who can turn good hitters into a pretzel  Jobe (along with Cincinnati's Hunter Greene) is one of two prep right-handers to be taken with a top-five pick in the past eight MLB drafts. While not the prototypical size of an ace, Jobe's case for going that high was easy to see. He is a plus athlete who was also a pro prospect as a third baseman (and whose dad Brandt is a pro golfer), with a starter delivery, easy mid-90s velocity, feel for an above-average changeup and breaking pitches regularly over 3000 rpm. His early pro career was rocky, but he's back on track to potentially be an ace in the coming years after making his MLB debut late last season followed by two playoff appearances.  Jobe's four-seam fastball results (whiff rates, ball in play outcomes, etc.) play a bit below the plus-plus shape and velocity of the pitch, but his changeup outperforms its pure shape in a way that I think is related, due to the 13 mph velocity differential. After gearing up for the 95-98 mph heater at the top of the zone (he occasionally throws a two-seamer with more run), the 82-85 mph changeup acts as a late-count putaway option once hitters have geared up for the fastball. Jobe's 88-91 mph cutter is probably his best long-term breaking ball given big league trends, but he has two varieties of a low-80s sweeper that are more likely to light up Pitching Ninja.  Jobe has an incredible combination of athleticism, arm speed, capacity for spin and ability to create lateral movement from a conventional high three-quarters arm slot. Using his average movement for each pitch, if he aimed the slower version of his sweeper (81 mph, 15.4 inches of lateral movement) and changeup (84 mph, -17.1 inches) at the same location, they'd end up 32.5 inches apart from each other. For reference, home plate is 17 inches wide.  There's still a little work to be done in dialing in the finer points of getting big league hitters out and ramping up to 180-plus-inning workloads, but Jobe could be one of the better pitchers in baseball on a per-inning basis whenever that last step of development happens.",55/60,60/65,55/60,60/65,,,,,,
7,8,Coby,Mayo,3B,Age: 23 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right,Right-Right,60,"Reminds me of: Somewhere on the Troy Glaus to Pete Alonso XL-framed infielder/power hitter spectrum  Type: 3B/1B tweener with 30-homer upside and solid feel to hit  GM Mike Elias found Mayo in the 2020 pandemic-affected draft -- his second draft running the Orioles. At the time, Mayo was a 6-foot-5 south Florida prep third baseman with big power but hit tool concerns due to his long levers. The O's believed Mayo was a swing tinkerer in high school and that obscured his underlying hit-ability, so they gave him early-second-round money ($1.75 million) in the fourth round after saving money on first-round pick Heston Kjerstad.  The Orioles were right and Mayo made his MLB debut at the end of 2024, setting him up to play first base or designated hitter during the 2025 season. He also has the ability to fill in at third base, but Mayo's size is a factor in limiting his defensive upside there and he's now seen as a likely long-term first baseman given both those limitations and the Orioles' deep infield corps. He hasn't played the outfield but has the raw ability to play passably out there.  Mayo has a good feel for pulling and lifting the ball along with above-average ability to pick out pitches to drive and average bat-to-ball ability. Unlike many of the potential power hitters on this list, Mayo (with his 22 Triple-A homers last season) has demonstrated the ability to get to all of his raw power in games against top pitching.",,,,,,40/50,60/65,45/40,40/45,65/65
8,9,Max,Clark,CF,Age: 20 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right,Left-Right,60,"Reminds me of: Shades of Corbin Carroll or Jarren Duran, if the power comes  Type: An explosion of personality, foot speed, bat speed and effort  Clark has been compared to Walker Jenkins for almost his entire prep career, and that continues into the minor leagues. They were the top two players in the 2023 draft prep class for years in advance and were drafted that way, but the next three players coming up on this list are all gaining ground.  As the information above alludes to, Clark is a stout, 6-foot athlete with plus explosive qualities in his hands and feet, but he also grades out well in the soft skills of bat control, pitch selection, baserunning and defending. If Clark can keep leaning into his 20-25 homer upside, he could be a true star, along the lines of Carroll or Duran, but there are outcomes in which Clark hits 12-15 homers annually and still makes some All-Star teams. The give-and-take that comes with those offensive-approach choices is the main question with Clark. Like Jenkins, Clark's wide base of skills and long track record give him as high of a floor as you'll see from a player below Double-A.",,,,,,30/55,45/55,70/70,45/55,55/55
9,10,Kevin,McGonigle,SS,,Left-Right,60,"Reminds me of: Maybe an infield version of Steven Kwan?  Type: Left-handed hitting prodigy with average other tools  McGonigle was one of my top picks to click in the five drafts I've covered for ESPN, all of them coming from a specific type who the industry continues to underrate: standout hitters with shorter limbs and strong performances against good pitching, medium raw power, good-not-great speed and defensive ability, but strong overall instincts. This profile basically doesn't get picked in the top half of the first round -- Max Clark is the toolsier version of this type -- but usually goes in the next 15 to 20 picks. McGonigle went 37th overall in the 2023 draft, but he got a bonus commensurate with the 28th overall pick that was created by the savings from the Tigers' first pick that year: Clark.  McGonigle is a solid-average runner with enough arm to play shortstop and good feel for the position, but there's a chance he still ends up at second base in the long term since many teams will have a better defensive shortstop option in the big leagues. He showed a feel for pulling and lifting the ball in 2024 with sneaky strong exit velos, but I wouldn't expect to see his homer total jump until 2026 because he broke the hamate bone in his right hand at the end of last year and that often dampens power figures for a season.  That said, I think he has 20-homer upside, some of the best on-base skills in the minor leagues (he incredibly has almost twice as many walks as strikeouts in his pro career) with positive baserunning and defensive value. There are some teams that have him ranked ahead of Clark, which was unthinkable even to me on draft day. I'll circle back to how I finished my predraft scouting report where I ranked McGonigle 21st, knowing I had him higher than everyone else due to a disagreement on his size/upside: ""Don't complicate this, MLB teams.""",,,,,,35/60,50/55,50/50,40/50,55/55

It became clear during the spring that only a couple of teams considered him seriously as a position player and he was a late-first-round talent on the mound, so football lost out once the Pirates offered $3 million at the top of the third round.  Chandler is quite similar to the next pitcher, Chase Dollander, as both are four-seam-fastball-dominant righties that both average 96 mph and possess bat-missing characteristics that belong at the top of the zone; both are in the handful of the best all-around fastballs in the minor leagues. Being drafted out of college and not playing football, Dollander is older and has more high-level reps while also pitching at a level lower than Chandler, so his whiff rates and other outcome-based metrics are a bit better than Chandler's. When you stack them up, Chandler has gotten further in the minors quicker by age and also by overall reps and has a better present changeup. They're close, but Chandler gets the edge here.",60/65,,55/60,,,,,,,

His 2024 season was a slight step back, as he broke a bone in his foot, then left the Arizona Fall League early due to a hamstring issue at the end of a season when his power numbers regressed a bit, admittedly back to predraft expectations.  The easy sales pitch here is that Emerson is a plus hitter with plus pitch selection from the left side who possesses 15-20 homer upside, an infield fit and solid speed. On the negative side, some evaluators think he's a stone-cold second baseman who lacks physical projection with hitting being his lone above-average tool. There are obvious similarities with McGonigle, with McGonigle showing a little more feel for in-game power and for playing shortstop, but both players are at a stage of development when a good bit can still change.

The main concerns at draft time were that Aidan looked like a third baseman rather than a shortstop throughout high school, was 19 on draft day (a historically negative indicator), and had missed much of his draft spring due to a hand injury. For those reasons, the Phillies got him with the 27th pick after he was projected to go in the top half of the round entering the spring.  In Miller's first full minor league season, he looked good defensively at shortstop, was running a tick better than high school, and hit better than even his most bullish supporters would've guessed on draft day while getting a late-season promotion to Double-A. He's now on the third-base/shortstop spectrum and I'm leaning toward third base due to his range. There still could be another tweak needed in his offensive approach to trade some contact for more consistent loft on hard-hit balls to get that 11-home run figure from his first full season to creep up as he moves up in the minors, but the raw power is there.",,,,,,25/50,55/65,50/45,40/45,55/55

Dollander put up huge numbers the next two seasons in Knoxville, winning 17 starts and striking out 228 batters en route to going No. 9 in the 2023 draft.  Dollander's 2023 was a slight step back for scouts as they focused on some small mechanical issues that affected his command, fastball shape and the consistency of his breaking stuff. It seemed correctable, and it was. He now has one of the best fastballs in the minor leagues, his breaking stuff has regained its crispness and his command has also improved. Dollander should spend much of 2025 in the upper minors, but could be ready to show his front-line potential in the big leagues as soon as the end of the season.",60/65,,50/60,,,,,,,
14,15,Leodalis,De Vries,SS,Age: 18 | Bats: Switch | Throws: Right,Switch-Right,60,"Reminds me of: A switch-hitting version of Willy Adames?  Type: Tooled-up young shortstop with real power; you can imagine almost anything  Every few international signing classes, there is someone anointed as the clearly best player in the class when they're 13 or 14 years old. They hold that title until they sign at 16, and it appears to be true as they get their feet wet in pro ball. That's who De Vries was and is, and the Padres pride themselves as an organization at finding players like this and acting before other teams do. It extends to their U.S. scouting, as well, with players like Jackson Merrill and James Wood who were either unknown until late in the process or were out of favor as prospects, but every scout agreed had great tools as 18-year-olds.  De Vries turned 18 while playing in the Arizona Fall League after playing 75 games in Low-A. San Diego is aggressive in challenging players they think have star potential and can handle the aggressive approach. Even as he's been thrown in the deep end of the pool, De Vries has shown excellent feel for pulling and lifting the ball in games, hitting 11 homers when his domestic age cohorts had just wrapped up their junior years of high school. If he continues to lean into that skill, I could see him hitting 25-30 homers at maturity and being a .240 or .250 hitter with a solid walk rate. Defensively, he could bulk up enough that many teams would move him off of shortstop. It's obviously early, so he could also choose to lean into contact and prioritize sticking at shortstop above all else. Either way, De Vries looks like an incredibly precocious potential star.",,,,,,25/50,45/60,45/45,40/50,60/60
15,16,Dalton,Rushing,C,,Left-Right,60,"Reminds me of: Carlos Santana with less contact, but a viable defender at catcher  Type: Squatty lefty hitter with power and patience who has come around as a receiver  Rushing was the No. 40 pick a year after Henry Davis went first overall and six years after Will Smith was the No. 32 pick -- all of them catchers drafted out of the University of Louisville. Now, Rushing is knocking on the door of the big leagues where he'll be competing with Smith for some reps behind the plate with the Dodgers. He's a later-blooming defensive catcher in part because he didn't get regular reps behind the plate at Louisville thanks to Davis' presence.  Rushing consistently posts plus walk rates and gets to his above-average power in games with great feel for pull and lift. Due to this approach and the step up in quality of big league pitching, his solid bat-to-ball skills should play down to below-average batting averages -- but with above-average on-base percentages. Because the Dodgers also have Austin Barnes behind Smith, Rushing will likely have to elbow his way into the lineup at designated hitter, first base, and corner-outfield spots. Rushing's pop times to second base play around average though his blocking, while fine, could use some work. Barnes is 35 years old and in the final year of his contract, so Rushing becoming a backup catcher who also finds his way regularly into the lineup elsewhere seems like how 2026 will begin, but Rushing may force that issue in 2025.",,,,,,40/45,55/55,45/45,40/50,55/55

He was tied to the Yankees earlier, and according to industry chatter, the deal dissolved due to the loss of international bonus space tied to New York signing Gerrit Cole as a free agent.  As an amateur, Basallo was seen as a possible catcher with a big arm behind the plate and big power potential from the left side. That's basically still the scouting report, but what's somewhat shocking is that Basallo hit his way to Triple-A as a teenager, even with a troubling chase rate. Hitters with big raw power and a tendency to chase pitches out of the zone (not to mention young catchers) tend to move through the minor leagues slowly, but Basallo is the exception to the rule.  In 2025, we'll see if his bat is deemed ready for the big leagues and he plays less behind the plate, or if the Orioles prioritize Basallo making progress to reach his defensive potential by keeping him in the upper minors for the entire season. Basallo still has a wide range of potential outcomes for a player who has reached Triple-A, as both his offensive and defensive profiles could boom or bust.",,,,,,30/40,60/70,35/35,35/45,65/65
17,18,Noah,Schultz,LHP,Age: 21 | Bats: Left | Throws: Left,Left-Left,60,"Reminds me of: There's some real Chris Sale vibes if it all clicks  Type: 6-foot-9 lefty with a low arm slot that creates tons of life on every pitch  Schultz was a well-known prep prospect with clear first-round ability, but he made it to the White Sox at the 26th pick of the 2022 MLB draft due to an unclear asking price, missing the beginning of the spring with an illness and command trouble when he did get on the mound. The command issues make some sense, given his long arms at 6-foot-9 create problems repeating his delivery and his low arm slot helps create so much movement on his pitches that they'll often run out of the strike zone.  Schultz threw just 27 innings through the 2023 pro season, but last season he threw 88.1 innings, mostly in Double-A as a 20-year-old. It'll take at least two more healthy seasons to work him up to a full big league starter innings load, and there's some work to do fine-tuning locations and sequences in the upper minors. At this rate, late in 2025 or early in 2026, Schultz will force his way into the White Sox rotation, even if there will be a pitch or innings count, and show his frontline ability.",,,,,,,,,,
18,19,Sebastian,Walcott,SS,Age: 18 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right,Right-Right,60,"Reminds me of: There's some Fernando Tatis Jr. as a prospect vibes, but I wouldn't expect that outcome  Type: 6-foot-4 infielder with 40 home run upside, but unclear position and contact ability  Walcott signed for $3.2 million almost two years ago out of the Bahamas. The Rangers have moved him aggressively through the minors, and he has performed well, especially when adjusted for his age. But it makes me wonder if he'd be putting up otherworldly numbers if he was a level or two behind playing with most of the other prospects his age.  I think both Walcott and Basallo, two spots above and also moved quickly through the minors, will end up as 240 hitters with average walk rates and 30+ homers annually. Walcott is a more impressive athlete because of his speed, but I believe he will eventually move to third base -- despite currently playing shortstop -- due to his projected size and strong hands. Basallo, on the other hand, is likely to be either a catcher or a first baseman. The key difference is that Basallo has already proven he can hit at a higher level in the minors.",,,,,,25/40,65/80,55/50,35/45,60/60
19,20,Josue,De Paula,LF,Age: 19 | Bats: Left | Throws: Left,Left-Left,60,"Reminds me of: Yordan Alvarez  Type: Precocious lefty whose value is completely with the bat, but he could still be an All-Star  Sign up for free fantasy baseball   The 2025 fantasy baseball season is here! Get the group together, or start a brand new tradition. Join or start a league for free >>  DePaula signed for $400,000 in the 2022 international signing class, but showed he was clearly better than his bonus later that summer in his pro debut in the DSL. He has continued to post after that loud debut, splitting his 2024 season between Low-A and High-A, and my ""reminds me of"" isn't made up; a rival team compared him to Yordan Alvarez. If you scoff because De Paula only hit 10 homers last year, go check Alvarez's minor league track record.  The downside of that comp is De Paula doesn't offer much in terms of speed, defense, or arm. The upside is that he isn't just raw power projection; he's also an above average hitter with plus pitch selection and current plus in-game power, though he hasn't fully leaned into pulling and lifting the ball as much as he probably will in a few years.",,,,,,30/55,60/70,40/40,40/45,45/45
20,21,Andrew,Painter,RHP,Age: 21 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right,Right-Right,60,"Reminds me of: Justin Verlander is a common comp, given the big stuff, frame, and high arm slot  Type: 6-foot-7 potential frontline starter that's coming back from surgery  Painter was identified early in his prep career as a potential first-round pick and he delivered on that upside, going No. 13 overall in 2021 out of a south Florida high school. In the pre-draft spring, Painter's stuff showed plus flashes -- getting into the upper-90s with a sharper slider -- after being more average-to-above the previous summer. This growth is notable, because his stuff took another step forward the next spring, regularly hitting 100 mph and overpowering hitters. As a result, he got to Double-A while becoming one of the best prospects in baseball, and he was ruled off limits in any trade. He opened the 2023 spring training with buzz that he would break camp with the big league team as a teenager.  Then the momentum stopped. Painter went on the shelf with arm soreness he tried to rehab, with the potential to get back on the mound in the second half of 2023. That didn't work, and in July, he had Tommy John surgery, ending his 2023 and 2024 seasons. Painter returned to the mound in the Arizona Fall league a few months ago and his velocity was back, with flashes of the old stuff, but he obviously wasn't at the same level just yet. There's a shot Painter looks like he did in 2023 this spring, but expectations should just be that he looks solid and will spend the 2025 season in the upper minors refining his craft with a 2026 big league rotation shot a distinct possibility. If he shoves in his first few spring outings, I'm sure the hype train will start rolling again.",55/65,,40/50,50/55,,,,,,
21,22,Ethan,Salas,C,Age: 18 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right,Left-Right,60,"Reminds me of: I can't think of anyone specifically, but the statline may look like Will Smith's  Type: Young lefty-hitting catcher with above-average tools and excellent feel for catching  I mentioned above with fellow Padres prospect Leodalis De Vries (No. 15) that occasionally there is a clear and obvious top player in an international signing class years in advance who backs up the evaluation immediately in pro ball. Salas wasn't quite as clear from the start as De Vries -- there was some support for Felnin Celesten, ranked later on this list, at various points of the process -- but by signing day, Salas was the consensus best player in his class.  Almost all of Salas' family (father, uncle, grandfather, older brother, younger brother) played or are playing professionally. Salas runs well for a catcher and is incredibly advanced for his age as a receiver and game caller, so all of the soft abilities you could ask for in a young catcher are present. On top of that, he's an above-average hitter with plus power projection and solid feel for getting to his power in games against older pitchers.  His 2024 season line at High-A doesn't reflect those skills, but he hit better than league average the final month of the season, and that carried over into a solid Arizona Fall League showing. Some scouts and Padres personnel saw mechanical and approach issues that Salas had in the first half corrected in the second, as the surface numbers suggest. Given the very low bar for catcher-hitting in the big leagues (the league-average hitting line is .234/.299/.380 with 13 homers per 450 plate appearances) Salas has a shot to be one of the top five to seven at the position in just a couple of years.    55 FV Tier",,,,,,30/55,50/60,45/45,45/55,60/60
