"Shunpeita Yamashita","SP","NPB",2028,"22.6083333","Japan","Orix Buffaloes",,,"6' 2""","215","R","R","55","High","Yamashita took an enormous leap as a ""prospect"" in 2023 when he sustained a five-tick (!) fastball velo bump despite a huge increase in his season-long workload. Yamashita posted a 1.99 ERA across 95 innings in 2023, his first in Japan's big league after two years with Orix's farm club. His 2024 got off to a very rocky start, and Yamashita was demoted to the bullpen and then the minors before he rebounded in a profound way and was utterly dominant down the stretch. 
A first round pick out of high school in 2020, Yamashita is now built like an NFL quarterback at a strapping 6-foot-2. In addition to his plus, mid-90s velocity, he features a monster upper-70s curveball with hitter-finishing depth. His seldom used splitter began to improve late in the 2023 season and by the end of 2024 was generating a ton of whiffs, getting by far the most chase and miss of any of Shunpeita's offerings. Yamashita has gone from a 21-year-old who might one day have three plus pitches to a 22-year-old who now does, albeit across a relatively small sample. Aspects of his profile are still volatile, and it's plausible his early-season struggles in 2024 stemmed from fatigue caused by his previous season's huge innings increase. But Yamashita's stuff, build, and athleticism are all indicative of a mid-rotation big league starter. He won't meet MLB's requirements for an amateur bonus pool exemption until after the 2027 season, so it will likely be quite a while before we see him on our shores.","bkbSXjZ_fU4",
"Munetaka Murakami","3B","NPB",2026,"25.0638888","Japan","Yakult Swallows",,,"6' 2""","250","L","R","50","Med","Murakami's 2023 and 2024 seasons were a bit of a letdown after his 10-WAR, 56-homer MVP campaign in 2022, but he's still been very good for a player his age in the world's second-hardest league. After 2022, he looked like a top three to five global prospect and arguably presented a more stable statistical argument than the similarly talented players from the lower-level MLB affiliates, since Murakami had multiple years of success against polished pitching in Japan. He has <em>merely</em> posted a wRC+ right around 150 each of the last two years, his lowest since his age-19 season (he debuted at 18) and a far cry from his godlike 223 wRC+ in 2022. His season ended with a broken big toe.
Murakami's deficiencies have remained mostly the same since his report was last updated. He is still swinging underneath a ton of fastballs up and away from him, and struggles significantly with velo. He managed to hit just .154 against fastballs 93 mph and above in 2024. He is going to be end up with a below-average MLB hit tool, and his whiff issues are profound enough that he has non-zero bust risk despite his success in NPB.
Titanic pole-to-pole power remains Murakami's carrying tool. He turns on mistakes that he sends into pull-side orbit while also spraying pitches on the outer half into the left field bleachers. There is a combination of strength, athletic explosion, and flashes of lower half flexibility here that few MLB hitters wield, and Murakami's pop stands out even when comparing him to MLB's most fearsome power hitters. He has a terrific ability to recognize breaking balls and offspeed stuff, and will often keep his weight back to hit secondary pitches the opposite way and use his natural strength to turn defensive swings into doubles. He has 40-homer raw power, though he'll probably hit fewer than that because of infrequent contact.  
Murakami improved as a third baseman in 2024 and now projects to stay at that position, albeit as a below-average defender. His grade slides for the second consecutive year as he looks more like a five-hole hitting 3B/DH.","rT-Ss-MQO9w",
"Liván Moinelo","SP","NPB",2026,"29.2138888","Japan","Fukuoka Hawks",,,"6' 0""","175","L","L","50","Med","Moinelo's 2023 campaign was cut short due to arthroscopic elbow surgery for osteochondritis dissecans, an injury involving bone and cartilage (but not ligaments) more common in youth athletes than adults. This, plus Moinelo's desire to move from the bullpen to the starting rotation, made his potential MLB timeline and role less clear than it had been for the last handful of years when he was a steady late-inning reliever for Fukuoka and the Cuban National Team. 
In 2024, Moinelo made a very successful transition to Fukuoka's rotation, posting a 1.88 ERA in 25 starts, which was fifth best in the league. He only pitched 30 innings before his season-ending surgery in 2023 and then 163 innings in 2024, and Moinelo's fastball velocity bent a bit under the weight of a starter's workload, but he was still going right at hitters with his usual velocity late into the postseason, holding in the 92-94 range. 
Moinelo is an exceptionally whippy athlete and he might have more in the tank as he gets further away from his surgery. He mixes in three distinct, MLB-quality secondary pitches pretty evenly and can pitch backwards off of both his changeup and curveball. Moinelo's early-career issues with walks began to rapidly improve starting in 2022 and he's now had three consecutive seasons of starter-quality control. He's not a surgeon, but he competes enough in the zone with four good pitches to be considered a good team's fourth starter. Coming off a very strong postseason, Moinelo and Raidel Martinez venture to Taiwan as part of Cuba's Premier12 roster.","bkiS-MPdKEM",
"Hiroto Takahashi","SP","NPB",2027,"22.5444444","Japan","Chunichi Dragons",,,"6' 0""","187","R","R","50","Med","Takahashi is one of the harder-throwing young pitchers in NPB, with a fastball that resides in the 93-95 mph range and was up to 98 during his Premier12 carving of Team USA late in 2024. He's held this velocity under a 150-inning workload each of the last two seasons. The 2022-23 offseason blurb for Takahashi indicated that I wanted to see his secondary stuff take a step forward, and his splitter and curveball have begun to. The curveball now has considerably more power and showed a four-tick velocity bump in 2023, while his splitter garnered about 40% chase and miss rates, per Synergy, in 2024. Takahashi is still very skinny (especially in his lower half) and tightly wound in a way that would give the amateur scouting world pause about his ability to start were he a college pitcher here in the U.S., but two consecutive years of velo gains under a pretty substantial innings load should help to quell those concerns. He has a mid-rotation starter look.","o3wEr_xVK1I",

Inoue is short, but he's an athletic anomaly with a very powerful delivery for a fellow his size. His upshot fastball can miss bats at the letters even though it isn't that hard, and Inoue mixes in several other pitches that break in different directions. His splitter is especially nasty, and he can vary the shape and depth on his breakers to match his opponents' vulnerabilities. This is as much a bet on Inoue's athleticism as any other aspect of his profile. He's in position to seize a Giants rotation spot in 2025 and become one of NPB's better pitchers during the next three seasons or so.","pHRVujMUQo8",
"Do Yeong Kim","3B","KBO",2030,"21.3972222","South Korea","KIA Tigers",,,"6' 0""","187","R","R","45+","High","Do Yeong is coming off a monster breakout in his age-20 season that ended with his KIA Tigers winning the KBO title. He slashed .347/.420/.647 with 38 homers and 40 steals while playing good third base defense, an MVP-caliber season. Of medium build, Kim has to swing hard to generate his all-fields home run power, and it's very difficult to tell whether his hit tool would hold water against MLB stuff with this style of hitting. If Kim can simplify his swing and retain good game power as he gets stronger, he'll give himself a better shot. Does he have 40-homer MLB power? No. There's more like 20-25 homer power here right now, and at a relatively generic 6-foot-1 or so, there's probably not much more raw power on the way. But Kim does basically everything well, he's fairly fast, and he plays a good third base for his age. He's got a shot to be a five-tool player, but none of those tools seems likely to be plus. Were he a college junior, he'd comfortably be in the first round mix.",,"kr3018059"

He has precocious bat control and gap-to-gap power. He's trained at Carlos Guillén's academy, and played for los Samanes de Aragua in Venezuela's LMPB (their summer pro league, distinct from winter ball) in 2024 against much, much older players, showing flashes of his power amid predictably inconsistent play. He lacks the premium projection of most top-of-the-class talents, but projects to have the contact/power blend of an everyday infielder.",,

He's averaged more than a strikeout per inning each of the last three seasons, a rarity in Japan. The very athletic and limber Taneichi has roughly average stuff, but he goes right at hitters and has improved his strike throwing and innings count each year since returning from TJ. He'd be a stable strike-throwing no. 4/5 starter in MLB.","jIXCGHjn24E",
"Shosei Togo","SP","NPB",2027,"24.8916666","Japan","Yomiuri Giants",,,"6' 3""","210","R","R","45","Low","Togo is a super durable and consistent starter who has already made four NPB All-Star teams at age 24. He operates at the bottom of the zone and below with great breaking stuff and a very tempting splitter that has remarkably consistent finish. Togo doesn't throw especially hard but he can really pitch, his secondary stuff is good, and he takes his turn in the rotation every time. He has exceeded 170 innings each of the last three years and kept his walk rate down in the 6-7% area. Though Togo isn't an exceptional athlete, he's lanky, and he's broad-shouldered and limber enough to repeat his delivery with ease. Higher release point pitchers like Togo sometimes lean into sink/tail action on their fastball, but that's not happening here yet, and his heater is vulnerable in the zone. Togo is having success in NPB and probably has another gear in his fastball at peak. Here he's considered a high-floored no. 4/5 starter type.","iW8ZmJP2EJc",
"Raidel Martinez","SIRP","NPB",2026,"28.3722222","Cuba","Nagoya Dragons",,,"6' 3""","205","R","R","45","Low","Martinez is a very long and lanky 6-foot-4 Cuban righty whose fastball will peak in the 99-100 mph range. Coming off an unbelievable 2023 — 46.2 IP, 0.93 FIP, 58% GB%, 36% K%, 2% BB% — Martinez set NPB's save record for a Latin American pitcher in 2024, netting 43 of them and surpassing Robert Suarez's previous mark. Martinez has kept his walk rate under 6% every year since 2021 and has been one of the more dominant NPB relievers of the past half decade. While his contract with Chunichi expired after 2024, Cuban reporter Francys Romero indicated on his Substack that Martinez will explore free agency in Japan rather than the U.S. and remain in NPB for at least one more year. 
Martinez throws very hard, and his combination of size, lever length, and vertical arm slot give him a release point in the troposphere. His heater is very tough to get on top of when it's located at the top of the zone, but Raidel's money pitch is a low-90s splitter that is not only capable of missing bats but also enables him to generate a ton of groundballs. An upper-80s slider gives Martinez a third viable weapon, and it generated a chase rate north of 40% in 2024. This is a plug-and-play late-inning reliever who looks like he'd be a setup man on a contender if he comes to MLB.","0-SdJsfgyCQ","sa3023350"
"Taisei Ota","SIRP","NPB",2028,"25.6555555","Japan","Yomiuri Giants",,,"5' 11""","195","R","R","45","Med","One of the nastiest relievers in NPB, Ota has stuff that would play in the late innings of an MLB game. He sits 95-96 with hellacious rise and run action, and will touch 99. He takes a big, low-to-the-ground stride, has incredible arm speed and a deceptive, whippy arm action, and the movement on his fastball is often explosive. Ota's splitter falls off the table when it's at its best, but his release isn't consistent, and whether Ota can polish his release point will dictate his ultimate ceiling. He could be an MLB closer one day, though because he was a college draft pick who only has three NPB seasons under his belt, he's still a few years away from being exempt from amateur bonus pools.","Ps5iQ2slG0o",
"Kazuma Okamoto","1B","NPB",2026,"28.6527777","Japan","Yomiuri Giants",,,"6' 0""","212","R","R","40+","Med","Okamoto has been one of NPB's most productive power hitters since 2018, and until 2024 had had six straight seasons of clubbing 30 or more home runs, including a 2023 campaign in which he hit 41 of them while slashing .278/.374/.584, good for a 178 wRC+. It was at that point that public reports surfaced about MLB teams scouting Okamoto. His 2024 campaign wasn't as stellar, as he ""merely"" slashed .280/.362/.501 but posted a career-best 15% strikeout rate. After the 2024 MLB season, rumors that Okamoto would be posted during the offseason grew within baseball but they weren't uniform. 
Okamoto's most resonant and interesting skill is his extreme ability to pull the baseball. His spray chart looks like Isaac Paredes', with all kinds of fly balls peppering the left field foul pole. Some teams' regression models seem to have found that hitters with high rates of pulled fly balls are more stable performers, and it's likely that teams that believe this will be the ones most hot after Okamoto if indeed he comes over to MLB. 
His swing has a little more movement and noise, but it's similar to Tommy Pham's. His front foot tends to land open, enabling him to pull the baseball in the air a ton. He can cover the heart of the zone from east to west, but he isn't a barrel control savant or anything like that; Okamoto is clearly a power-over-hit guy. His hands are very strong, capable of putting a charge into the ball even when he doesn't square it up. 
But whether Okamoto can actually perform like he has against big league fastballs is up for debate. His spray chart against fastballs has been more balanced to all fields and less pull-heavy. When you limit his opponents' sample to fastballs 94 mph and above (only about 200 pitches across all of 2024; the average NPB fastball was 90-91 mph), his numbers fall off a cliff. As a likely first base-only big league defender (he has seen time at third base and in the outfield each of the last couple years, but has overwhelmingly played first base), Okamoto has very little margin for error on offense. He's a potential option for teams in need of a power bat, but this evaluation is worried enough about his fastball issues to put him comfortably south of the average starting first baseman in MLB.","cMZfx8Rpu1g",

His hands and actions are sensational, and Mizuno's athleticism shines on that side of the ball and also helps him punch above his weight in the batter's box. There are a lot of wee shortstops in NPB, but Mizuno has sneaky pop; he had 25 extra-base hits in 105 games in 2024, including eight triples. He swings really hard for a little guy his size, and his swing has loft that lets him get to power. He's a fun little player with a good utilityman's toolset.","xsByf5gl6z4",

His twitch and physicality would stand out even among MLB peers and, at a sculpted 24-years-old, he may have another gear of power in him at maturity. As impressive as Mannami's showcase tools are, he's still an unpolished hitter who chases and takes out-of-control swings. Barring a significant change to his approach, Mannami is likely to have volatile, low-OBP output. His range and arm strength make him a plus corner defender and help create an Austin Hayes type of overall profile if things pan out.",,

He cut his strikeout rate in 2024 but didn't slug quite as much. He has now exceeded 22 homers in each of his four NPB seasons, and Maki has maintained a 90% or better in-zone contact rate the last three campaigns, giving him a rare combination of raw power, NPB performance, and relative youth. This evaluation is relatively skeptical of him transitioning to MLB with the same level of performance. Maki is chase-prone against secondary stuff (in 2024, he had a chase rate approaching 40%) and can be successfully crowded around his hands. He's a stocky guy with below-average flexibility and range on defense, but he can make some slick, jump throw-type plays at second base.","qeUtIWoEDlw",

When he returned very late in 2023, in time to pitch just 15.1 innings before the end of the season, his stuff was back, and that carried over into a totally healthy and productive 94.2 innings in 2024. Hsu was reaching back for 98 and sitting 95-96 at the very end of the 2024 season. The athletic little righty and his drop-and-drive delivery generate uphill angle on that fastball, and Hsu's secondary stuff (especially his splitter) has continued to improve as he's gotten pro reps. He now looks like a nasty long reliever, and if he can sustain his stuff across another 50 innings or so, he'll have earned MLB starter projection. His hard slider/cutter might end up being a better offering than his slow curveball relatively soon, and give him another above-average weapon. This is a very exciting young pitcher who might end up being posted to an NPB team for a year or two before he entertains MLB offers.","FrB3P2aPraw",

He has a chance to be a special defensive center fielder because of his speed and arm. Though he's smaller than most other top international prospects, he packs a pretty good punch for his size.

But his future has been clouded by compulsory military service, which he still needs to complete because of an incident that occurred in high school and has since precluded him from competing with Korea's national team, blocking the pathway to an exemption. An also had Tommy John after the 2023 season, which kept him out for all of 2024. 
His fastball velocity improved into the 92-97 mph range in 2022 even though he nearly doubled his previous season's innings mark. He will top out at 99, working with downhill angle in most of the zone. While his fastball command is a bit scattershot, An fills the zone with an array of breaking balls, most frequently his mid-80s slider and upper-70s curveball, which have distinct shape and utility. He'll tend to use the curveball as a finishing pitch, while the slider and cutter are more neutral, strike-garnering offerings. An has some reliever characteristics (lack of changeup feel and fastball playability), but he has the stuff to be some kind of impact arm in MLB if his stuff returns after surgery. It's possible An's need to complete military service will complicate his career or the timing of his matriculation to MLB.","xt32c-dkSmE","kr3012678"

He's a shortstop fit with average hands but plus range, athleticism, and arm strength. He tended to spray low-90s fastballs to the opposite field against Team USA, and we'll see how he handles pro velocity on a more regular basis — there's just no way of knowing how that's going to go until it happens. But for now, Muneyama has a balanced offensive skill set. He moves the barrel around, he can turn on inside pitches, and he sprays a lot of line drive contact all over the place. His well-composed, medium frame has room for strength and power. Mostly because of his defense, Muneyama looks like a mid-to-late first round MLB draft prospect, with hit tool volatility akin to a small conference hitter.","MDyuGJ-edhI",

He has a power fastball that peaks at 99 mph and sits 93-96 with flat angle created by his lack of height. At 5-foot-8, Tseng is short but he isn't small, and his lower body is incredibly strong and flexible, helping quell concerns about durability. Conversely, Tseng enjoys the benefits of having a lower release height because he's so short, which helps the bat-missing shape of his fastball. The finish of his slurve is rather inconsistent, but it's possible a big league dev program could quickly improve that part of his game. He looks like a solid middle reliever by virtue of his fastball, and he has a chance to be a more impactful, higher-leverage contributor if an MLB team can improve his breaking ball. 
Somewhat surprisingly, Tseng filed for international free agency after the 2023 season, but he didn't end up leaving the CPBL. If that happens again soon, it is likely an NPB team will swoop in because Tseng is subject to MLB's amaeur bonus restrictions until he's played a few more years of pro ball. A shoulder injury kept him off the 2024 Taiwanese Premier12 roster, so it's perhaps more likely he ends up matriculating to a tougher league after 2025. He has impact relief potential.",,

"Baek-ho  Kang","1B","KBO",2026,"25.5722222","South Korea","KT Wiz",,,"6' 0""","215","L","R","40","Med","Kang's performance in Korea is on the upswing again after two years marred by injuries and time away to deal with anxiety. After a very strong start to his pro career, Kang broke his toe falling down a flight of stairs before the 2022 season started, then partially tore his hamstring just a few weeks after he returned. A bout with anxiety shelved him for a month in 2023, and his season ended with an oblique tear. After he hit 29 homers in his age-18 rookie season, Kang hit just 14 combined across the 2022 and 2023 campaigns before rebounding somewhat in 2024 with a .289/.360/.480 line and 26 bombs. 
Peak Kang has plus power and one of the more aggressive, entertaining swings in Asian pro ball. In his early 20s, I evaluated him on the level of a mid-to-late-second round collegiate draft pick, but he's fallen due to his injuries and budding hit tool question marks. Kang is chase-prone and has a huge, hard-to-time leg kick that would probably make him whiff-prone against fastballs that are five ticks harder, on average, than the ones he faced in 2024. He's still worth following and it's good that he had a full 2024, but Kang needs to find another gear to have true MLB projection.",,"kr3012665"
"Ryosuke Ohtsu","SP","NPB",2026,"26.1166666","Japan","Fukuoka Hawks",,,"5' 8""","160","R","R","40","Low","A very bouncy, athletic little righty with a consistent delivery, Ohtsu has plus command of stuff that is mostly average or below. His changeup has enough movement to miss bats in the strike zone against NPB hitters, but that might not be as true in MLB. Ohtsu also looks much more comfortable landing his 80mph-ish slurve for strikes than he does using it as a chase pitch. If he can find a chase-inducing breaking ball, he might take a leap because he has the command to weaponize it in such a way that it will outperform his raw stuff. For now, he looks like a potential backend starter in MLB thanks to his ability to work very efficiently.",,
"Hiroya Miyagi","SP","NPB",2027,"23.5","Japan","Orix Buffaloes",,,"5' 7""","182","L","L","40","Low","Miyagi is thriving as a starter in NPB, but the low-slot lefty has the look of an effective long reliever in MLB. His mediocre fastball velocity and lack of a truly effective third pitch are barriers right now, but his slider is a dynamic weapon.",,
"Carter Stewart","SP","NPB",2026,"25.3138888","USA","Fukuoka Hawks",,,"6' 6""","220","R","R","40","High","Stewart was among the top high school pitchers in the 2018 draft. The Braves picked him eighth overall, but flunked his post-draft medical (wrist) and tried to sign him for a reduced amount. During that stretch, the relationship between the player and the team disintegrated, and Stewart, who was committed to Mississippi State, chose not to sign. Rather than go to Starkville, he spent a year at a Florida junior college to more quickly re-enter the draft, but his stuff took a dive and so did his draft standing. He made a move to Japan with an eye on pitching there until he was granted unrestricted free agency after six years. 
Stewart initially struggled to throw strikes and spent all of 2022 in the NPB equivalent of the minors, walking nearly a batter per inning. In 2023, he finally got an extended run in the NPB big league, where he threw most of the 100 combined innings he worked between the farm club and the Hawks. He took a step forward in 2024 when he threw 120 innings and improved his peripheral stats. Stewart continues to sit 93-95 with fairly hittable downhill plane that makes it imperative that he begin commanding his fastball more consistently to the top of the zone. He could also stand to become stronger and more flexible in his lower body, anything that might help flatten the line on his fastball or help him repeat his delivery more consistently. Stewart's trademark curveball still has fantastic, bat-missing depth, and he has added a firmer, mid-80s slider and, most prominently, a splitter. All of these play down because of Stewart's poor control. Given his pro track record of strike-throwing, Stewart remains a relief prospect at this point, but he has gotten better in this area and has another year to improve before he might be in position to consider a move to MLB.",,
"Yukiya Saito","SIRP","NPB",2026,"30.1388888","Japan","Hokkaido Fighters",,,"6' 0""","200","L","R","40","Med","Saito tore his ACL just before the 2023 season, and his debut with Hokkaido (who got him in a trade with Hanshin the year prior) was delayed until 2024. Saito's fastball velocity was up in 2024 and he sat 96 all year. He has a very explosive arm action and can touch the upper-90s, but he needs to find a second plus pitch to work as more than a middle reliever in MLB.",,
"Dong Ju Moon","SP","KBO",2029,"21.1722222","South Korea","Hanwha Eagles",,,"6' 2""","216","R","R","35+","High","Moon is one of the better young pitching prospects in Korea, as he has something closer to a typical MLB pitching prospect's frame and plus present arm strength. Thrust into a starter's role in which he worked 118 innings as a 19-year-old, Moon held mid-90s velo all season and touched 99-100 at peak. His stuff was a little bit down in 2024 as he threw about the same number of innings. Moon has a hard, mid-to-upper-80s slider and upper-70s curveball, both of which flash bat-missing depth. There are some round-down elements to Moon's fastball, and his command and overall game need polish, as you might expect from a pitching prospect this age. But his ability to sustain premium velo (for Korea, anyway) is a promising sign for his long-term future.",,"kr3018231"
"Yuhi Nishidate","SP","NPB",2028,"22.9555555","Japan","Yomiuri Giants",,,"6' 0""","174","R","R","35+","High","The power-armed Nishidate is one of the harder-throwing young pitchers in NPB. At age 22, in his first pro season, his fastball averaged 93-94 in roughly 70 innings of swingman work combined between Japan's minor and major league. He throws hard, flashes a good cutter and curveball, and a splitter was slowly emerging from his arsenal toward the end of 2024. He has the stuff foundation to be an effective MLB pitcher, but were he a prospect in domestic affiliated ball, he'd be on the starter/reliever line and a little less developed than most other 22-year-olds.",,

He's been relatively wild and walk prone for Hanshin, which was his biggest issue while in affiliated ball, but he still throws relatively hard (lots of 93-96 mph) and has added a splitter to his mix after leaning on his breaking ball a ton during his last stateside stint. The splitter isn't a plus pitch yet, but it's relatively new. There's a chance for three average or better pitches here, but Keller still needs to show he can throw enough strikes to stick on a big league roster.",,"18890"

He sits 95, and has been up to 98. He still doesn't have his body or breaking ball under control. The fastball will likely be a monster pitch for him, but he needs a second weapon and better command.

"Julian Tima","3B","NPB",2029,"20.4166666","Dominican Republic","Yomiuri Giants",,,"6' 4""","200","R","R","35","High","Tima has been among the more fascinating (and niche) prospects followed closely here at FanGraphs since he was signed out of the Dominican Republic to the Yomiuri developmental roster in February of 2021 for nearly $700,000. After doing what amounts to backfield activity until 2024, Tima finally got regular reps for Yomiuri's Eastern League farm team and slashed .251/.292/.425, with 15 HR, 21% strikeouts, and 5% walks in 400 PA. His size, bat speed, and the kind of power he projects to end up with at physical maturity are all remarkable. This is a very physical 20-year-old who still hasn't totally grown into his body, and some of his best hacks are incredibly explosive. There's huge hit tool risk here. Tima is a super deep projection prospect and long-term name to monitor in the event that things click for him now that he's begun to get actual in-game reps.","xcjqT3EvaCs",
