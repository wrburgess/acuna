It's not expected to be a long-term issue, and Franco himself wanted to rest and return to action for Escogido (the left side of los Leones infield would have been him and Vladimir Guerrero Jr.), but the Rays prevented it as a precaution. I suppose there's some chance that this issue, combined with the presence of other good shortstops in the org like Willy Adames and Taylor Walls (assuming either or both aren't traded) creates a heightened chance that Franco debuts in the big leagues as a second baseman, but even if we knew that was going to be the case, he'd still easily be the best prospect in baseball. 
In fact, last year Franco became the first 80 FV prospect of the Future Value era at FanGraphs, the best prospect on the planet, and the best I've evaluated during my tenure here at the site. Recall Franco's statistical track record, which is better than Vladdy's was at the same age and levels: He has played 175 career games, all at levels well above what is typical for a player his age (he doesn't turn 20 until March). During those games, he hit .336/.405/.523 with 71 extra-base hits, 20 steals, and more walks than strikeouts. In fact, across two levels in 2019, Low- and Hi-A, Franco not only walked more than he struck out, but walked about <em>twice</em> as much. He has one of the lowest swinging strike rates in the minor leagues at a paltry 4.8%. Franco's short levers and lightning-quick wrists make it nearly impossible to beat him with velocity, especially on the inner half. He is also especially adept at spoiling well-located back-foot breaking balls, and if you miss with one and catch even part of the zone, he can drop the bat head and yank it out to his pull side. Work away from him and he'll extend his arms and pepper the opposite field gap with line drives, then use his speed to turn lots of those into doubles. He has impressive raw juice in BP, which he shows off because he makes such consistent contact (his 2019 Futures Game BP was better than Jo Adell's and Nolan Jones' even though those guys have bigger raw power), but it's possible Franco's in-game power hasn't fully actualized yet because he still hits the ball on the ground a lot (48% in 2019, with just a 9 degree average launch angle). And yet he's still slugging like a physically mature Quad-A hitter. How about the TrackMan data? Franco's exit velos and hard hit rate (which are on The Board) are both above the big league average, which is ridiculous for a teenager who's playing against competition four and a half years older than he is. 
He might not ever produce huge home run totals without a swing change (someone told me, ""If that's true, then imagine a Michael Brantley-type of hitter who switch-hits and plays shortstop""), but it'd be ridiculous to alter this guy's swing considering how elite his performance has been, and I think the elite bat-to-ball skills will enable him to hit for more game power than his raw.  Franco has been the best player his age on the planet since he was 14 years old. He looks like, and has performed like, a generational talent and annual MVP contender. <em>(Alternate site, LIDOM)</em>",OsxMtDgMaI0,23667

I think this is a real, relevant change and helped drive his debut season's triple slash line, a star-like .281/.382/.641 in the regular season and God-like .500/.538/1.042 in the playoffs. A pertinent data point here is Arozarena’s max exit velo, which was 109 mph in 2019 and moved up to 113 mph in 2020. This is a measurable change in physical ability, the reason for which is well-publicized and which is supported by a visual evaluation of Arozarena’s physicality. And I’m not too worried about the sudden uptick in his strikeout rate because it not only occurred in a small sample but is way above his career norm of 18.5% (I'm avoiding recency bias), and the circumstances surrounding it (Arozarena rolled out of quarantine bed and faced big league pitching for the longest stretch of his life) are odd. We also got our first glimpse of how opponents are going to pitch to Arozarena now that he's a certified masher, and I think that his walk rate and OBP are both going to take a pretty serious leap. His newfound physique might also bring about a change to his approach to contact (this guy once looked like a leadoff hitter) as he continues to get a feel for what it's like to have this much juice, but I'm not sure how that will manifest on the field. I think the added weight has made him a worse defender and now have a 40 on him in left field, not that it matters. He's likely to anchor the middle of the Rays order for the next half decade. It should be noted that Arozarena was involved in an altercation related to a custody dispute this offseason; he was released from custody after his former partner declined to press charges. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",4VdQSUbzmz8,19290

He got regular big league at-bats during spring training ahead of the shutdown, then had some very high-profile homers during summer camp and at the alternate site, which you probably already know because the Mariners' prospect PR machine is very strong (maybe too strong for the club's own good). I wrote last year that even though Kelenic had become a maxed-out beefcake, it hadn't detracted from his ability to play a fringe center field. More recent looks indicate that is no longer the case. During several spring looks he failed to make plays on balls that I'd expect an average center fielder to make, especially fly balls in the gap that ideally your center fielder runs down. Kelenic's size at his age may eventually push him to the 1B/DH realm, or at least cause him to slow down and be below-average in an outfield corner. 
I don't think it matters. Kelenic rakes. His feel for contact, strength, and mature approach combine to make him a lethal offensive threat. He is short to the ball with power and can rip his top hand through to catch fastballs at the top of the zone, which bodes well for him against a pitching population that is working up there with increasing frequency. His short levers help him get to velocity on the inner half, and his swing path also enables him to get extended and put balls away from him in the opposite field gap. He's been the among the most polished hitters his age since he was 15 and has a track record of statistical success dating back to his underclass high school days -- he's just added upwards of 30 pounds of muscle to that foundation of skill. He's the most stable of the 60 FV prospects and likely to make an immediate impact now that he's on the major league roster. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",LFdX2RZaB64,22558

The data does some pushing and pulling. In about a month, Hayes hit a whopping .376/.442/.682, ranked fourth among all hitters with a 195 wRC+, and led all NL rookies with 1.7 WAR even though he only played in 24 games. And Hayes was hitting the ball hard. His big league average exit velocity (just shy of 93 mph) and HardHit% (55%) were both above what he posted in the 2019 minors (91 mph, 48%) when he only hit 10 homers over a 100 games. But his .450 BABIP is unsustainable and, per Statcast, his xwOBA (.356) came in well below his actual wOBA (.464), indicating that he was also the beneficiary of some luck. There's no accounting for how big league pitching might expose a weakness and begin to adjust to Hayes, even if it's just to limit his power output rather than get him out. But his approach is responsive enough that I think he'll target pitches he can drive and do enough damage to, when coupled with his world-class defense at third base, make him a multi-time All-Star. <em>(Alternate Site, MLB)</em>",o76lKnW1nX0,18577

Some of that doubt is the result of his size (I specifically don't have these concerns), while the rest is the result of his sub-par control/command. Indeed Patiño's BB/9 rose as he was promoted to each of his previous four minor league levels, culminating in a gnarly 16.5% walk rate during a small 2020 big league sample. For someone as short as Patiño is, his arm swing is actually quite long, and his tactile feel for release has seemingly regressed as he's gotten more muscular. But remember that this is one of the better on-mound athletes in the minors, who is still only the age of a college prospect, and who hasn't had elite velocity for very long. Since he signed, Patiño has gained about 40 pounds and added about 10 ticks of fastball velocity. More important context: Patiño is a converted infielder who has only been focused on pitching for about five years, and one of those was seriously disrupted by the pandemic. Certainly Patiño needs to find more mechanical consistency and his fastball location needs to move north. Plus, his changeup feel is still quite raw. But if this guy were at LSU or UCLA, we'd be talking about him as the odds-on favorite to go number one overall in this year's draft. I still project Patiño as a multi-time All-Star starter. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",k11tj7Ee2qs,22815

In the AFL, Marsh's hands loaded a little farther out from his body and he had what some scouts called a ""wrap"" or ""power tip,"" where the bat head is angled toward the mound a bit, setting up more of a loop than a direct path to the ball. I thought he lifted the ball better during that six week stretch and did so without compromising his strong feel for contact. But the lost 2020 season (even if I sourced launch angle data from the alt site, guys were facing the same pitchers over and over again, so I just don't think it's meaningful) and Marsh's ongoing shoulder issues (he had a labrum injury in 2020 that barked at him again early this year) have prevented us from getting a clear idea of this change's impact because his contact quality has been poor this year. 
Marsh has a great first step in center and has fantastic gap-to-gap range. He has struggled to close the deal on fly balls approaching the wall this year, dropping several catchable though not routine balls (they're only catchable because his range is so good). All of this has occurred amid off-field adversity (Marsh's father recently passed away; Fabian Ardaya of <em>The Athletic</em> wrote about Marsh's dad, their relationship, and his father's several bouts with cancer late in 2019) and a nagging injury. I suppose one could argue that the persistence of the injury itself is value-altering but for now I'm not inclined to come off of Marsh at all. I worry that this year will be a struggle because of the chaotic nature of his world for the past couple of years, but ultimately I see a well-rounded player who's going to reach base and hit for power at above-average rates while also playing plus defense at a premium position. There are All-Star-level tools here and a contact/OBP performance foundation to fall back on even if I'm wrong about the swing finally being dialed in.",f6w57ie4WkA,20202

Everything he throws comes out of a very deceptive overhand slot that makes it difficult for hitters to parse his curveball from his fastball, and Anderson knows how to use each to set the other one up for a finishing blow. But Anderson's best weapon is his changeup, which has a lethal combination of tail and dive. He's no sniper, but Anderson can throw all three pitches for strikes and induce chases with all of them. He's a high-probability mid-rotation starter and is likely to graduate from rookie status just a few weeks into the 2021 season. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",tgygzB4auuw,19951

Then in late August, he was shut down with a forearm strain, the first real blemish on what had been an immaculate track record of arm health (his 2018 IL stint was due to an oblique injury). Manning has publicly downplayed the severity of that injury and has been healthy and throwing all offseason without issue. We'd rather he have been totally healthy, but this injury doesn't seem severe enough to alter his stock. 
All of the physical components that many front-end arms have while they're in high school were present when Manning was an amateur -- shooting guard frame, premium arm strength and athleticism, a breaking ball -- and remain so today. He has pretty good feel for location and balance for a young 6-foot-6 guy who takes such a gargantuan stride off the mound, and that should continue improving with time and reps. Manning starts on the extreme first base side of the rubber and has a cross-bodied, drop-and-drive style delivery that creates flat angle on his fastball, which gets on hitters quickly. And Manning goes right at hitters with that fastball (60% in-zone rate in 2019), which has the cut/carry traits typical of a power pitcher's fastball. His arm slot is much different now than it was in high school, a testament to Detroit's dev group and Manning's ability to make adjustments without a drop off in on-field performance. Since entering pro ball, his walks have come down, Manning's changeup has gotten better, and he started working with two different fastballs and was clearly manipulating the shape of his spike curveball depending on the hitter and situation in 2019. Now he's working on a second breaking ball. Assuming the forearm issues are behind him, Manning has front-end starter ceiling and will likely make his big league debut in 2021. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",k-sipbEctAU,20369

He hit .259/.394/.444 in the spring off of admittedly diluted pitching, then grinded out long, tough at-bats during the summer tune-up against a staff that would turn out to be quite good. He's also one of the more decorated college hitters ever, slashing .374/.495/.688 at Cal. 
He's very likely to clear the high offensive bar at first base. He's not a great feet-and-hands athlete on the infield but Vaughn's swing is pretty athletic, and sweet. He doesn't chase and seems to have a narrow early-count approach focused on pitches he can crush. He's less able to damage well-executed breaking stuff away from him, but he often spoils those pitches or puts them in play and, again, typically doesn't offer at them until he has to. There's a clearer path to the big leagues for Vaughn now that Edwin Encarnacion and Nomar Mazara are no longer on the roster (I talk more about this in the System Overview), and he'll likely play in the big leagues in 2021.

He's also athletic and moves well for his size. I still have some questions about his ultimate upside because I think he's much more likely to end up in left field than in center. His instincts in center are okay, but I don't think he has the long speed that is typical at the position. His 2019 minor league TrackMan data indicates his statline from that year was a bit of a caricature, but his Savant page indicates the opposite with regard to his 2020 debut struggles. I wonder if pro models have been overrating Carlson due to his age because even though he's only the age of a college bat, he doesn't have the physical projection you'd expect of a hitter that age. Of course, it's not like Juan Soto still has physical projection, either. The league-average offensive production in left field has been lower than you might expect (good for a 100 wRC+ over the last five years) and Carlson might also be able to play a situational center when the Cards are behind and need offense, as well as some first base. That versatility is valuable icing on a switch-hitting cake.

His swing looked much different than all the other kids'. At the time I wasn't sure whether that was good, or if I thought it would work in actual pro games. I've seen other high schoolers hit balls much harder and farther than he did at that age, but I still haven't seen anyone scoop the ball in the air with that kind of consistency in a derby or BP setting. And now Kirilloff -- despite missing 2017 due to Tommy John, and after dealing with recurring right wrist issues that tanked his offensive output in 2019 then being unable to rebound statistically in 2020 because of the pandemic -- was asked to make his big league debut during the playoffs and is likely to be handed an everyday role in 2021. The departure of both Eddie Rosario and Nelson Cruz means the Twins need two more big league lineup cornerstones, and Kirilloff is the by far most likely internal candidate to be one right away. 
Healthy Kirilloff is going to hit and hit for power. Part of why I was skeptical of his swing in high school is because he strides open, his front foot drifting way down the first base line rather than back toward the pitcher. This allows him to turn on balls most hitters are jammed by, but he still has the plate coverage and swing path to lift contact the other way when pitchers work away from him. Ironically, Eddie Rosario's swing worked in a similar fashion, and the two are also similarly free-swingers. I was skeptical of Rosario's at the time (incorrectly), and he doesn't have the kind of power Kirilloff does. A thickening build has slowed Kirilloff down, and he's now spent some time at first base after beginning his career in CF/RF. I think we'll see him play a combination of first base, right field and DH depending on the starter the Twins are matched up against on a given day. Corner bats who like to swing as much as Kirilloff does can be pretty risky, but I have a high degree of confidence in this one because he tracks pitches well and sprays hard contact all over the place. I think he's going to be a 3-ish annual WAR, middle-of-the-order anchor. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",l3xPPnRQA7o,20325

He was horrendous early the next season before he slowly began to throw more and more strikes as the draft approached. He's dominated opposing hitters since signing, amassing 212 strikeouts in 145 minor league innings before his 2020 big league debut. Until he set foot in the big leagues, Skubal had some relief risk because he was working with his fastball at a bizarre rate in the minors. His delivery looks like a pterodactyl is trying to throw a baseball, and it forces hitters to deal with a very strange look and angle, as well as big velocity and carry at the top of the zone. So unhittable is Skubal's heater that he's struck out 37% of hitters during his minor league career (48% over the final few weeks over Double-A play in 2019) while throwing the pitch roughly 70% of the time. No current big leaguer with a fastball that plays at the top of the zone throws their fastball that much, and anyone close to 70% is a sinkerballer. 
During his initial 2020 big league trial, Skubal was quite wild early on but, just as in his draft year, he slowly started to work more efficiently toward the end of the summer. His changeup (which has lateral action but almost no sink, which is sort of bizarre) and slider are now clearly his best non-fastball weapons, though he can only reliably throw the fastball for strikes. In addition to some of the visual command problems, Skubal's release point is highly variable. Because he has such a nasty mix of stuff, and because he has shown a slow, but relevant command progression in the past and seems to be doing it again, we're still inclined to project Skubal as a mid-rotation starter rather than the highest-ranked reliever on this list. He'll generate amazing rate stats early in his career but probably won't work deep into games, but he has top-of-the-rotation ceiling if he can develop better command. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",bcoy-xb3kJY,22267

He has much better feel for contact than all but a few players in the minors, let alone the catchers. It has allowed Ruiz to get away with an overly-expansive approach. He swings at far too many pitches outside the zone, but he is so often able to get the barrel there that it hasn't mattered, and he's a .299 career hitter in spite of this. While Ruiz makes remarkably consistent contact, it's not all that hard, and he's unlikely to hit for more than doubles power in the big leagues. But I think even a one-dimensional, contact-only offensive profile like Keibert's is enough to catch everyday, and while I consider him a capable defender, it's worth noting that some clubs do not. 
Ruiz has baby soft hands and is a great pitch-framer and receiver, but he's a casual, low-effort ball-blocker who'd much rather rely on his hands to pick balls in the dirt than be mobile and throw his body in front of the baseball. I think his hands are so good that he'll get away with this, but others think it impacts his pitchers' conviction in throwing breaking balls that finish in the dirt. Arm-wise, Ruiz's slow exchange drags his pop times down, but he's very accurate and I'm starting to think that so long as one has sufficient arm strength, accuracy might matter more than the pop time. But again, this is not a universally-held belief. I've got an everyday grade on Ruiz, but unless the Dodgers want to carry three catchers, I think he is the odd man out and a potential trade centerpiece this offseason. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",jGl4H285JjI,19610

His arm action is a little stiff and long, but boy is it fast, and it generates a fastball in the 92-96 mph range (mostly 3s and 4s) with riding life. Gray’s size and the drop-and-drive nature of his delivery combine to create flat pitch approach angle that helps his fastball miss bats at the top of the zone. Thanks to his athleticism, Gray repeats his mechanics, and throws more strikes than is typical for someone who has this kind of nasty stuff but has only been pitching full-time since 2018, and he has an especially notable proclivity for locating his fastball to his arm side. 
The slider can slurve out and even get kind of short and cuttery at times, but when it's well-located and Gray is on top of the ball, it’s a plus pitch. His changeup, which he seldom used in 2019, induced some ugly swings during the Dodgers' pre-season intrasquad games, so it appears that offering has made a leap. Gray has been making constant adjustments to his repertoire for the last couple of years and has not only succeeded but quickly became good enough to compete (in a practice environment) against the lineup that would eventually win the World Series.

He was sitting 92-96 as a rising sophomore on the Cape, but often sat 90-94, and sometimes 88-91, throughout his starts the following spring. Last year, he was again up to 96 but sat 91-94, about the halfway mark between his peak and nadir as an amateur. Considering how readily pitchers lose velo in pro ball, that's still a win for Seattle. Even though it only sits 93-94, Gilbert's fastball is his best pitch and the way he most effectively whiffs hitters, though maybe his changeup will show some late development. While all of Gilbert's secondary pitches are average and flash above, I think his command will enable them to play above their raw grades, which, combined with what the innings count could be because of his frame and how efficiently he works, will still make him an above-average WAR generating starter. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",l0Jw6egZzJg,22250

But we're sufficiently scared of Mize's injury history (a strain that required a PRP injection in college, shoulder inflammation in 2019) to slide him behind players of a similar talent. If he stays healthy, then he'll be a (WAR-based) No. 2 starter, capable of pitching at the top of a contender's rotation, and likely have dominant stretches over the next half decade. Mize's fastball doesn't have bat-missing carry but when he's totally healthy, it's hard and he locates it as well as his plus-plus splitter. We don't think his upper-80s ""slider"" has the length to miss bats and instead think it'll eventually be used to induce weak contact rather than as a putaway pitch. His curveball, which Mize has better demarcated from his ""slider"" since entering pro ball, might emerge as the finishing weapon. There remains a large swath of the industry that is fearful of cutter/splitter guys, and we don't know if that's justified but it certainly impacts how teams internally line up the Tigers prospects. What we do think is that players who have been hurt in the past are the ones most likely to get hurt again, and while we know it's begun to feel like every pitcher gets hurt at some point, there's more smoke here than in most other cases.

Pleasant HS (TX),"It sometimes feels foolish to ""wait for things to click"" with very talented but frustrating (and perhaps flawed) prospects, but that's what it seemed like was actually happening for Kopech just before he blew out his elbow late in 2018. The surgery's timing meant Kopech lost all of the 2019 regular season and began rehabbing in a game environment during Fall Instructional League. His first bolt was 99 mph. He settled in at 96-99, and threw several plus sliders. Kopech made his spring 2020 debut on March 10 and threw 11 pitches, six of which were 100 mph or more. It was his only inning of 2020, as Spring Training was shut down soon after, and Kopech would later opt out of the season amid the pandemic and other meaningful off-field considerations. As such, his evaluation is the same.
Kopech's trademark heat and slider give him late-inning potential even if he can't start, an outcome that seems more likely during the early part of his big league career now that he's missed two seasons and may take time to build up an innings load. He'll be able to start if he can command that slider to the back foot of left-handed hitters; he needs to have an out-pitch against lefties and some sort of viable third pitch, which I think will more likely be a second breaking ball than a split or a changeup. If he can do that, I think he's a 3-to-4 WAR starter. <em>(At-home dev)</em>",JXUYoulUEo8,17282

Despite having never played above A-ball, he was called upon in 2020 to help prop up a beleaguered big-league infield in Cincinnati, where the flaws in his approach were hard to ignore: he struck out 38.2% of the time, against a mere 1.5% walk rate. He started his 2021 season in Double-A, where he posted a career-high walk rate, which he improved upon at Triple-A later in the season while maintaining a livable (though still uncomfortably high) strikeout rate. In his 85 minor league games, split more or less evenly between the two levels, he slashed .303/.380/.539 for a 147 wRC+. 
He closed out the season with a three-week stint in the majors, and largely thanks to a slew of IL stints at the big-league level, he ended up playing more innings in center field than at shortstop despite having never previously played there as a professional. This is no cause for alarm, though – he's still a plus-plus infield defender with quick hands and an instinctive feel for his footwork. If anything, adding another defensive position could allow him the additional at-bats he needs to translate his minor league offensive success to the big league level. He hasn't done that yet, though, and Barrero’s most recent major-league promotion brought with it a return to the troubling approach issues he’d displayed in his first big-league stint. His walk rate fell to 5.4% while his strikeouts ballooned above 30% in his 380 big league at-bats. There’s certainly some valid questions surrounding his ability to improve that approach against top-tier pitching, but the defense and his minor league numbers continue to bolster confidence in his ability to adjust over time.",oe9MB7KStTA,23378

Larnach remains a sluggish, diffident outfielder, but he's very likely to get to much of his titanic raw power in games thanks to the ease with which he generates the pop -- Larnach doesn't swing with violence or effort, it's just there -- and a refined approach. His swing is a little more compact now than it was in college but Larnach will really get extended on balls away from him and punch them the other way.

The players who surround him on that leaderboard -- Luis Arraez, Eric Sogard, and David Fletcher -- are all similar offensive players who make elite rates of contact but have almost no power. More precisely, Madrigal is most like Arraez because of how opposite-field oriented their contact is. If you prorate Fletcher and Arraez's performance over the past few years, they're pretty well above-average players, and Madrigal is a better defensive player than Arraez and is a wash with Fletcher at second. I just think this reinforces the industry's long-standing eyeball evaluation that even though he's quite small and is not going to hit for power, Madrigal is a very good player. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",tQxQekapA8k,20521

But that twitch and violence, Jazz's awesome ability to uncoil his body from the ground up and rotate with incredible speed, the natural lift in his swing -- many of the things that make him whiff-prone also make him exciting, and give him a chance to be an impact offensive player who also plays a premium defensive position very well. His skillset is somewhere on the Chris Taylor/Javier Báez continuum of strikeout/power offensive profiles at a premium defensive position, though the low-end of his potential outcomes looks like Freddy Galvis: a plus-gloved shortstop who hits for power, but with an OBP around .300. 
I wanted to see another year of plus walk rates before declaring that to be a true part of the skillset (Chisholm walked 11% of the time in 2019, up from a career 8%), but the pandemic made that impossible and Jazz earned the everyday second base job in Miami with his 2021 spring performance. His power is real (a 91.4 mph average exit velo would put him in the top 40 of the majors, while 48% of his balls in play being over 95 mph would be in the top 30), the lift is there (he has a career groundball rate in the low 30% range and a 17 degree average launch angle according to a source), and Jazz is athletic enough to be a plus defender at shortstop.

This time his malady, described as right elbow tightness, was actually arm-related after he had previously dealt with an intercostal strain and a fractured ulna caused by a comebacker. The Blue Jays shut him down for about a month, and when Pearson returned he did so as a reliever. Upon coming back, his fastball velocity was not only intact but he threw harder than he did as a starter before he was shut down (he averaged 99 mph after ""only"" throwing 96 as a starter). After just one post-injury regular season outing, Pearson came out of the bullpen in the final game of Toronto's Wild Card round loss to the Rays, and absolutely paved over Tampa Bay hitters who had just shelled Hyun Jin Ryu. The question the industry hoped Pearson would answer in 2020 was, ""Can this guy hold upper-90s cheese all year, every fifth day, as a starter?"" I think the answer to that is probably no, and I also think that based on how difficult it's been for him to build a starter's inning count in the minors, Pearson might spend his first couple of big league seasons in some kind of truncated starter's role or as a multi-inning relief weapon. 
But he does have front-end stuff in his fastball and mid-80s slider, which is often a 70 on the scale. Pearson also walked a bunch of hitters during his 2020 debut but his in-zone location rate was about the big league average, and he pretty consistently executes his fastball and slider where they should be located, so I think it's unlikely he moves to the 'pen for command-related reasons. He also has a curveball and changeup that round out the starter-worthy repertoire, though he's never really been able to throw that curveball for strikes and I'd speculate that the changeup ends up as the tertiary pitch here. His changeup flashes plus but his feel for locating it consistently isn't great, and I think that pitch needs to develop if he's going to max out as a starter. Because FV is a WAR-based prediction and Pearson's innings are likely to be somewhat limited early in his career, perhaps I should have kept his FV in the 55 tier even though he returned from the elbow injury with his usual velocity. But I'm 60'ing him here because of his high-end outcomes, which I think also include a truly elite relief possibility. There's a chance Toronto eventually does with him what the Reds did with Aroldis Chapman, where the team is competitive and Pearson is thriving in a relief role, so they just leave him there. (Update: Pearson has had two 2021 IL stints instigated by groin strains. It's not an arm injury, but it's nagged him in a way that makes it more worrisome than your typical one-off lwer body strain for a pitcher. It makes it more likely that he spends the ealry part of his career in a high-leverage reliever because he's been totally unable to build an innings count due to the pandemic and injury. We still think he'd be an elite closer immediately, and this is where he value that level of performance in that role.)",t_D8-uewjYw,20160

Once softer and relatively unathletic, he's transformed himself from a high-effort relief type into a potential workhorse mid-rotation starter. 
Manoah still leads with his fastball/slider combo, and remains hulking and somewhat stiff-looking. That power fastball/slider approach to pitching and the Sal Romano body comp creates an air of bullpen risk, but that was the case with Nate Pearson once upon a time, and isn't anymore. Manoah can back foot his slider against lefties and his changeup flashed average in college, so he has a foundation of platoon-fighting weapons at his disposal, and changeup development was the focal point of his alternate site activity. He showed no ill effects from a big innings increase from 2018 to 2019 and was still 93-96 with his heater late in the summer after he signed; he continued to pitch in the mid-90s during the summer of 2020. Changeup and command consistency will reinforce the mid-rotation forecast, which is currently a right-tail outcome rather than the likeliest one, making those the things to look for when he pitches in 2021. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",xjl8MA97TKA,26410

He now starts with a narrower base than before, and his hands are set much lower to start, changes that theoretically create better rotation up through the kinetic chain and natural swing loft, respectively. We won't know if the changes have a substantive impact on Duran's power output until sometime in 2021, as his alt site hitting metrics are meaningless because they were generated against the same mediocre pitchers he saw over and over, but visually, it now appears Duran can better lift pitches in the bottom of the zone. He didn't exactly hit for power in Puerto Rico over the winter, though, and the org thinks it's because his new swing requires more precise timing, which Duran hasn't yet found. 
Still, let's not forget Duran's tools (he's a 70 runner) nor the foundation of statistical performance he has laid dating back to college. Duran hit a career .294 at Long Beach State but produced almost no power and slipped to the seventh round. Then he torched short-season and Low-A ball after signing, and began 2019, his first full pro campaign, with a ridiculous .387/.456/.543 line at Hi-A. But after seeing him at the 2019 Futures Game, I thought there was a gap between his talent level and that of the typical Futures Gamer, to his detriment. He posted a middling Double-A line during the back half of 2019, and he was similarly underwhelming during an extended look in that season's Fall League. 
Despite his speed, Duran's instincts in center field are still not good (though they've improved), and he relies on his speed to make up for what he lacks in off-the-bat feel and anticipation. It's possible the swing change has unlocked the power necessary to make Duran a regular, but it's also possible that it has de-stabilized his feel for contact. We won't know until he's generated a bigger statistical sample with the new cut. I have him in as a fourth or platoon outfielder, a 1.5-ish WAR type of player. <em>(Alternate site, Liga de Béisbol)</em>",L8gFdZbJcrc,24617

But there is skepticism surrounding his long-term athletic viability because Kirk is a very husky guy (listed at 5-foot-8, 265) without a body comp precedent in baseball, or arguably across all of pro sports. Because Christian Vazquez is listed at 5-foot-9, 205 (which is either an embarrassing oversight or an intentional lie), the closest measurable comp to Kirk is José Molina at 5-foot-10, 250, but that's from when Molina was nearly 40-years-old, whereas Kirk is only 22. It's very difficult to anticipate what might happen to his frame as he enters his mid-20s, when many other players are thickening up as they reach maturity. All of this creates doubt surrounding whether or not Kirk can catch right now and/or long-term. But because he made his major league debut in 2020, we've gotten to see him do it a handful of times, and for a lot of different pitchers, at the big-league level. Kirk's receiving and framing are okay. He catches on one knee even with runners on base, which makes him especially good at framing balls toward the bottom of the zone. He sets his target then lets his glove hand go slack and works back to the ball as it heads home, which magnifies issues with visual presentation to umpires when his pitcher misses his spot. In general, Kirk just has a slow-moving glove and doesn't catch pitches at the top of the zone as cleanly as the softy sinkers at the bottom, and I wonder if he'll have more obvious issues catching power arms, though he did fine in two outings as Robbie Ray's backstop. Kirk's legs set up as wide as they can go when he's in his modified crouch so he can try to block balls without actually having to move his whole body laterally, and it actually works okay. He's not a great thrower despite an average arm because he's so slow out of his crouch, and sometimes he'll throw from one knee to circumvent this. 
My visual evaluation is that he's a passable defender, not a good one, and I think the Jays deep stable of catchers will dictate that he DHs sometimes and catches at others. The more 1B/DH Kirk has to play during his years of team control, the less valuable he'll be. He has an all-fields, doubles-oriented approach that prioritizes contact and walks, which I think is great for a catcher but won't be at first. He's an everyday big league catcher right now, but he may have an abnormally early decline phase. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",,22581

Howard's fastball was sitting 93-97 deep into his best 2019 Fall League outings but only averaged 94 in 2020, and his command backed up, too. I'm taking a longview here. Remember that we're talking about a small school pop-up reliever who, due to a past shoulder injury and the pandemic, has just one full pro season as a starter. Howard has impact stuff. His changeup is plus, he can blow his fastball past lefties near their hands, his slider has big time action to his glove side, and his low-70s curveball is a nice look to present hitters the second and third time through the lineup. His breaking ball lacked backfoot angle in 2020 but, based on how Howard has described his shoulder issues impacting how he pitched, that may come if he and the Phillies staff can find a way to put the shoulder problems in the rearview.

Then McKenzie was living in the 93-96 range in his first start and leaned on the fastball in big spots, often shaking off Roberto Pérez to get to it. Over the next few weeks, McKenzie's velocity dropped in each subsequent start before it spiked again in a long relief role at the very end of the season. You could argue the injuries and fluctuating velocity are indications that the long-held industry apprehension regarding McKenzie's durability has turned out to be correct. But it also would have been unreasonable to expect any pitcher to hold their velocity as they got deeper into their first extended action in quite a while. The action on McKenzie's fastball also gives it some margin for error, velo-wise. And both his slider and changeup have evolved to complement the fastball/curveball combo that had headlined his arsenal as a younger prospect. Even though it's still unclear exactly where his fastball velocity band will sit during the course of a whole season, I think McKenzie has the necessary other components to pitch in the middle of a rotation. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",SaiUEE5AOzQ,18000

Jeffers took to this style and answered some of the defensive questions he faced in college, when it was unclear if he'd catch or end up at first base. Eyeball evaluations of his receiving are still mixed but according to my sources (and not just ones with Minnesota), the framing metrics in the minors were good, and they were very positive during his month-long stay in the big leagues last year when Jeffers was thrust into the lineup due to Mitch Garver's injury. 
So long as he can stay back there, Jeffers is pretty easily an everyday player. He has average bat-to-balls skills, above-average thump, and the ability to hit the ball in the air consistently. He essentially made the leap from Hi-A to the big leagues in 2020 and hit .273/.355/.436. I think it's fair to expect the Jeffers will experience a BABIP regression in 2021, but I think we'll see his strikeout rate (which historically was close to 20% and was 30% in his initial big league trial) come down, too, which will help balance that out. His athleticism, breaking ball recognition, and, perhaps most importantly, plate coverage are all a tick below average, but I still think there's enough offensive ability here for Jeffers to profile as an everyday catcher. Garver's presence could impact Jeffers' playing time, and since most of Jeffers' defensive value is tied to his receiving, his overall career production might be front-loaded due to the looming possibility of electronic strike zones. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",,24618

The ZiPS projections conducted by our own Dan Szymborski this winter loved Kim so much that, purely based on those forecasts, he was one of the top free agents available last offseason.

The Padres made a four-year bet on him (with a fifth year mutual option) with the notion that he'd be a superutility man. His defensive hands and actions are sufficient for shortstop though not great, but he has the speed and athleticism to play anywhere and make a lot of high-effort plays.

Lynch still brings big lefty velo (four- and two-seamers) to the party, as well as a bevy of solid secondary pitches. He throws a spike slider, curveball (really just a release variation on the slider, based on my 2019 high speed footage), and changeup. They're all mostly average, but the slider flashes plus and I think the changeup has room for growth.

(Major league teams were skeptical of that explanation and thought his absence had to do with an off-the-field matter.) In that lone appearance this spring, Crochet threw 3.1 innings and was absolutely electric, touching 99 with his fastball while flashing a 70-grade slider. How teams valued him leading up to the draft (the relief risk, the injury or makeup issues) was highly variable. Their confidence seemed to be determined by who in the org had seen him and when (many teams weren't able to get a decision-maker to see him in person in 2020), but those that focused on his pitch data, which was shared among all the teams, thought he had among the best raw stuff in the entire draft class and was one of the few pitchers available who might pitch at the top of a rotation or in the back of a bullpen. Crochet was also among the high-octane college pitchers thought capable of going straight to the big leagues in a relief role, something more broadly considered by clubs due to the structure of the 2020 player pool. Out of Burl Carraway, Clayton Beeter, etc., only Crochet actually did. 
After he tuned up at the alternate site for about two months, Crochet was added to the 40-man and sent to the big leagues in mid-September. He pitched six innings in five relief appearances, walked no one (though he was pretty wild if you put on the tape), allowed just three hits and no runs, and struck out eight big leaguers. He made the White Sox playoff roster but left his first career postseason outing with a flexor strain, which ended his season. He's healthy now, training and throwing at the team's complex in Arizona. Because he barely threw in 2020, he's likely to be on a strict innings limit in 2021. The club is going to try to thread the needle here and use Crochet in a relief role while still trying to develop him as a long-term starter.

It'd be foolish to construct a new opinion of his offense from an eight-game statistical sample but it was instructive to watch him catch most of a big league staff during those three games behind the plate. 
Stephenson catches on one knee with the bases empty, then from a crouch with runners on. For most fastballs, his glove works from the middle of the plate outward, and for breaking balls he typically works from beneath the zone, up. The latter is more effective from a pitch-framing perspective, but both approaches are fine from a receiving standpoint, which was an issue for Stephenson as a younger prospect. So, too, was ball-blocking. Stephenson is 6-foot-4 and his wickets are pretty big. His legs often get down late when he has to block a ball, but they're so long that he ends up having good lateral range by using his length to slide around. Even then, Stephenson mostly tries to use his glove to pick balls in the dirt rather than get his knees down and pads over the ball, which may affect pitcher confidence in his ability to block balls. Stephenson avoids tipping pitches with runners on base. His legs bow out wide when a breaking ball is coming, but it happens too late for the baserunner to signal the hitter. I suppose we don't know how well he will be able to block the nastiest of breaking balls, but I think he clearly looks capable of catching and will be at least an average defender with a big time arm. 
Offensively, Stephenson puts on quite a show during batting practice but has a contact-oriented approach in games. Per a source, he had one of the better in-zone contact rates in the 2019 minors, which is quite the opposite of how most of the amateur side of the industry thought he would develop as a pro. It's possible he eventually makes an adjustment that unlocks more in-game power, but I think a contact-first approach that derives power from Stephenson's strength is still plenty for him to profile as a good, everyday catcher. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",HDhq33FljWA,17988

In 2019, as many orgs have done, Mariners catchers began working on one knee, a move that tends to be favorable for framing but not for throwing, a skill of dwindling importance (at least for now). Perhaps not coincidentally (or perhaps because we were wrong about Raleigh's arm grade last year, when we 55'ed it), reports on Raleigh's arm strength are worse than they were a year ago, though it appears he's a viable long-term catcher, if an unspectacular one. He popped anywhere from 1.9 to 2.04 for me during the spring, but Raleigh's throws tend to drift away from the bag. So while he isn't a run-stopping defensive wizard, Raleigh does enough to catch, and switch-hitting catchers with power like this are rare. 
And I'm pretty confident about him getting to most of the power in games. Raleigh hit 29 homers in 2019 (most of those coming in the Cal League), he's typically run groundball rates in the low 30% range (meaning he hits the ball in the air a lot), and the sourced TrackMan data to which we have access reinforces the visual evaluation of Raleigh's strength and power. He projects as an everyday catcher and is a Pick to Click to make next year's top 100 who needs to be added to the 40-man this offseason.

DH types with OBPs in the .310-.320 range typically max out in the 2-3 WAR range, which is where I expect Mountcastle to peak.

But things started to unravel from there. A finger injury, bad weather, fluctuating stuff, frustrating control, and questions about his maturity all contributed to a draft-day tumble to pick No. 31 and the hometown Rays. 
A year later, those concerns seemed trite. A more consistent, balanced delivery enabled McClanahan to throw more strikes and he absolutely carved A-ball. He got especially hot over a nine-game stretch at Hi-A, where he walked just eight over 49 innings. He ended up with 154 K in 120.2 innings, and reached Double-A.

This is as gutsy and competitive a young guy as there is in the game, and that's part of why he's totally remade his body and is out there competing at the big league level at age 21 while other kids from his high school graduating class are in college or the mid-minors. But Weathers' stuff has been on a roller coaster for the last couple of years, culminating in the joint inflammation that occurred in a late-April start against Arizona. 
After a dominant beginning to his first full pro season, Weathers' stuff seeped away and he was eventually shut down with a dead arm and missed a chunk of 2019. When he returned, the mid-90s heat from early in the year did not, and Weathers' strikeout rate fell during the dog days of summer. When I saw him later during 2019 instructs, he sat 86-90 for much of his outing, albeit with excellent command, especially of his slider. Last spring, before the pandemic really hit, Weathers was once again living in the mid-90s, and he held that velo for a whole year before he had to leave that aforementioned start against the D-backs with soreness; his fastball was down in the 87-88 mph range. This has happened with Weathers enough that it impacts how I line him up as a prospect despite how quickly he's reached the bigs. There are exceptions, but it's also not typical for a pitcher with a body and delivery like this to stick in a rotation, and while Weathers has surgical slider command, he makes more grip-and-rip use of his fastball and has barely thrown a third pitch as a starter.

The skills foundation that made him a former top prospect remains: Trammell sees a lot of pitches and should run above-average OBPs, he runs well, and will either end up playing a viable center field, or a dynamic left field. I've typically projected Trammell to left due to lack of arm strength.

He took a big step forward during his freshman year at Florida, though the rest of the talent on that pitching staff pushed him to a bullpen/midweek/spot starting role for much of his career. The industry still valued him in the first round by the time he was a junior, and Washington selected him 29th overall in 2016, before trading him that winter for eventual title contributor Adam Eaton. 
Dunning had a very strong 2017, when his prospect value hit its pinnacle; he was viewed as a near-ready No. 4 starter and a core part of Chicago's rebuild.

Both Garcia's slider/cutter and curveball are average, though his slider has a little more lateral movement than it did in 2020, so maybe that pitch is above now.

He no longer looks like the sort of pitcher who'll produce peripherals like that over a full season and I'd expect both of those rate stats to fall. The lack of a short- and long-term workload track record and the leap Garcia might be asked to make in a rotation coming off a short 2020 create some extra volatility here, but Garcia's arm action is so loose and his lower half is so robust and strong that it might be less of an issue for him than it would be for others.

When he's right, the long-armed, side-winding right-hander chucks upper-90s stuff with either heavy sink, or rising cut action caused by his arm angle. He also throws a hard, horizontal slider. The Trackman readout for Doval is shocking. His primary fastball/cutter spins in at about 2700 rpm, which is incredible considering how hard he throws. He also generates nearly seven feet of extension, and the effective velocity of his fastball is about 2 mph harder than its actual velo. There are outings where he's untouchable for several innings. He also has nuclear outings where he walks everyone and gives up a bunch of runs before registering an out; this has now been the case for several years. 
Doval has been 94-97 during 2021 spring training and is on the 40-man, but is still a prospect of extreme variance since his stuff has almost no precedent and I can't decide if that's good or not. With someone like Kervin Castro it's easy to see the fastball angle and carry and know that's going to play, while Doval could be a waiver wire roller coaster or answer the question ""What if Brad Ziegler had elite velocity?""",N5S-D2ZA5lQ,21992

Then Paredes went to Mexico, where he has spent each of the last three offseasons, and as usual was the best hitter in the entire Pacific League. He's quite comfortable in the box, and shows balance throughout his swing and fantastic hand-eye coordination. Playing winter ball has helped Paredes keep his high-maintenance build in check and it's better now than it was when he was in the low minors with the Cubs. He's just not a very good athlete or defender and doesn't have the thump typical of a corner infielder who can't field well. There aren't many contact-only third basemen in the game, and this, along with concerns about his athletic longevity, caused us to slide Paredes out of the back of the Top 100.

He finally made his big league debut in 2020 and worked with a two-seamer, four-seamer and slider across three starts, with his fastballs sitting in the 90-96 mph range. Some folks in baseball think he'll be a Justin Masterson-style starter, and perhaps he'll be put in that role as the Sox rebuild, but on a competitive team, I have Houck projected in a multi-inning relief role, and think his velo could climb to the top of that 90-96 band and touch above it in shorter outings.

Now two inches taller then when he signed, Hentges is a huge-framed 6-foot-8, comes from a cold-weather location (he's not even the most famous Sam Hentges from Minnesota, as another is a hockey prospect for the Wild), played both ways as an amateur, and lost a year of development to surgery. That he's still raw at age 24 really isn't all that surprising, nor do I find it particularly concerning, though admittedly some of that confidence comes from knowing how hard Hentges was throwing in his big league outings this spring before the shutdown. In those brief outings, Hentges was living in the 96-99 range after sitting 92 (peaking at 96) last year. Cleveland did not baby his innings after he returned from TJ and perhaps 2019 was a bit of a stuff hangover year for him. If he holds this new velo, even if he only does so out of the bullpen, that kind of fastball and Hentges' breaking ball are enough to make him a big time relief piece. He has crude changeup feel and it seemed to be a focus for him during his spring outings. There's still a chance that comes along (remember, this guy has all the late bloomer traits) and Hentges can start, but the (healthy) floor of a lefty reliever who throws as hard as he does is still exciting even if he can't. <em>(Alternate site)</em>",,18548

He was at the 2020 alt site and got about 30 PA in the big leagues, the first of his career, then played pretty consistently for Toros del Este in the Dominican Winter League before a limited 2021 big league spring run due to a groin injury that shut him down in mid-March. He is a flawed but super-talented player with among the most electric bat speed in pro baseball and a huge lefty cut that produces some epic home runs, though probably not enough to make him an everyday player even though he's talented enough to be one. 
I, like much of the industry, am scared of corner-only prospects who clearly lack plate discipline, and Sánchez is one. He's run a 6.5% career walk rate and tends to get himself out by making poor swing decisions. Additionally, Sánchez's swing has not fully actualized for power (a seven degree average launch angle in 2019, a groundball rate around 50%), so he's fighting an uphill battle to get to his huge raw juice in games since he's either swinging at pitches he can't do anything with or failing to lift a lot of the ones he can. Despite this, Sánchez has performed statistically so far: he's a career .291/.337/.452 hitter, though he has begun to show cracks at Double-A and above, where he's slugging under .400 in 135 games. Again, if you watch Sánchez's bat speed, you'll find it ludicrous that he's not hitting for power. He hits balls very hard (50% of his 2019 balls in play were hit 95 mph or above) and he has feel for contact, just not for contact in the air. A pro scout recently said to me, ""The thing about hitting the ball really hard on the ground is that it's still really hard, and difficult to turn into an out.""

A minimalistic swing enables him to make high rates of contact, while the strength in Miller’s hands generates doubles power. It’s not an exciting, athletic style of hitting but on an inoffensive, fundamentally sound defensive shortstop, it’s a pretty interesting skillset. Barring a significant swing change, Miller’s offensive output will likely cap his ceiling near the 45 FV range, but for a third round pick who moves quickly, that’s a great outcome. 
Miller is arguably polished enough to play in the big leagues in 2021, and with the club's shortstop and first basemen struggling to hit early on, he may need to. If Cleveland ends up with a one-year stopgap, Miller doesn’t have to be put on the 40-man until December of next year, so even though he’s a polished hitter with upper-level experience and could feasibly be called upon to provide above-replacement-level reps in the event that Cleveland’s middle infield is beset by injury, he doesn’t have to occupy a valuable 40-man spot until it is absolutely necessary. <em>(Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)</em>",vTrfrO-oxJ8,24655

In June it will have been seven years since he was drafted third overall as a bat-first catching prospect who it was thought at the time might have to move to third base or right field if, like Bryce Harper, his defensive development was slowing his bat's ascent through the minors. But Jackson got very heavy very quickly and instead fell down the defensive spectrum out of athletic necessity. Over-aggressive elements of his approach were exposed and, from the outside, it appeared his relationship with the org had soured. The Braves acquired him for Max Povse and Rob Whalen about two-and-a-half years after he was drafted and asked him to catch exclusively, which he has done since joining the org. 
During that time some things have changed. For one, Jackson showed up to 2021 camp looking as svelte and lithe as he has since high school. He's now catching on one knee (which he did last year) even with runners on base (which he did not) and has become much better at framing low pitches as a result. At times, his ball-blocking appears to suffer from this new style but he's still popping in the mid-1.90s on throws to second. Once someone we thought might only catch once an electronic strike zones is implemented and DH until then, Jackson now looks like a viable defender. While he remains a power-over-hit guy, he has rare pop for any player, let alone a catcher. His 2019 minor league HardHit% was one of the highest in the minors, with a whopping 51% of his balls in play that year scorched at 95 mph or more. His epicurean approach at the plate, and what it does to his peripherals, makes Jackson a hit-tool risk, and at most other positions that would be very scary, but at catcher that's going to be fine. While he'll likely begin his career as a backup, Jackson's pop should also get him into the lineup as a DH pretty frequently. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",HIPG1LxMnlQ,17276

Díaz is a plus athlete, which is incredible for someone his size, and his infield feet, hands, and actions are all plus as well. He has a low hand load and a bat path geared for hitting breaking balls and low pitches, and over the course of watching him in the big leagues and at length during his time playing for Estrellas Orientales, I'm pretty scared that big league arms will be able to get him out with velocity at the top of the strike zone. You could argue that Díaz is actually in a pretty good position to hit in an environment that looks like it might soon feature more breaking pitches than fastballs, but if pitchers can beat him with topside velo, that's how they'll attack him.

Even though he hit more than 50 home runs combined in 2018 and '19, and slugged about .560 during that span, García's peripherals were so horrendous that he still managed to post batting lines below league average because he was only reaching base at a .290 clip, and everyone in the PCL was hitting for big power at that time.

Brentz touched 101 on the stadium gun the first time I saw him (100 on a scout's gun near me) and he never threw a fastball below 95 mph in any of my three looks at him. His feel for locating his slider improved as the spring went on and he now spots it to his glove side pretty consistently.

The background here is odd. As a draft-eligible redshirt sophomore, Rooker hit .324/.376/.528 with 11 homers at Mississippi State, and the Twins drafted him in the 38th round.

Nobody was totally sure what to make of such remarkable improvement, and Rooker lives in the dreaded right/right 1B/DH bucket for most evaluators, but he had among the best raw power and exit velos in his draft class and emphatically torched the best conference in college baseball. 
Rooker has moved quickly since entering pro ball (he needed to, as he's already 26) and played his entire second full season at Triple-A, where he mashed (.280/.398/.535), though his inability to deal with breaking balls was worrisome. After beginning the summer at the alt site, Rooker got a week-long cup of coffee in September and crushed a bunch of the fastballs he saw, but struggled against breaking stuff. He's a pull-heavy fastball hitter to whom I think opposing pitchers will adjust, but while I typically put corner role-playing bats like this in the 40 FV bucket, Rooker's raw power is so exceptional that I think he'll have unusual impact for a player in that role, so he'll likely graduate as a 40+ FV part-timer. <em>(Alternate site, MLB)</em>",,19627

I wrote last year that Mercedes is built such that he looks ripped and fat at the same time, and if you've been watching him catch for Licey in the Dominican Winter League, you can see he's begun to trend toward the latter. It doesn't matter all that much though because, anticipated rule changes or not, he can't catch, nor can he really play first base. Instead, his is a DH-only profile with serious strength, bat speed, and hand-eye coordination that might enable him to play a valuable situational role if he can overcome a propensity to chase. It's not as if the Yermínator lacks any kind of approach. With two strikes, he ditches his huge leg kick and focuses on putting the ball in play with just his hands and wrists, and he often still hits the ball hard like this because he's so strong. 
Perhaps he'll have some trade value once baseball moves to a universal designated hitter but I tend to think Mercedes' epicurean sensibilities at the plate would undermine his ability to play every day. Instead, I think if he's deployed in situations where the opposing pitcher can't pitch around him and has to throw strikes, he'll be a very, very dangerous late-game hitter.

His velocity climbed from the 90-93 range back into the mid-90s during that time period, but he wasn't exactly dominant for Licey. 
He has a drop and drive delivery that creates a really flat approach angle on his fastball, especially at the top of the strike zone, but Gutierrez's heater currently has other attributes (its spin rate and axis are indicative of sink/tailing action) that don't suit this style of pitching, and he's been homer prone throughout his career. There are several potential solutions. He might be able to just bully the extra velocity past hitters in a relief role, or he may eventually lean into the sink/tail aspects of the fastball and work off a two-seamer (Julio Teheran is actually a pretty clean athlete/delivery comp for Gutierrez). Or the new dev regime might tweak something -- perhaps his hand position or stride direction -- to try to shape how the fastball moves, if Gutierrez is receptive to it. He's a good athlete with a four-pitch mix, but I'm betting we see velo and curveballs in an eventual relief role. <em>(Fall Instructional League, LIDOM)</em>",,19278

His heater has big tailing action and is capable of running off the hips of lefty batters and back over the plate. As I wrote regarding Julian Merryweather on the Blue Jays list, just because this guy is 30 doesn't mean he’s not a prospect. He’s rookie-eligible, has roster flexibility, and is under team control the same as any young player. He’s also a pitcher who clearly has immediate big league bullpen utility. The likelihood of age-related decline during his years of team control does complicate where he falls on the FV scale since I care about all six or seven of those years, but teams need to decide how they value a guy like this versus a more traditional prospect, so I will, too. Would you rather have Nance or Anderson Espinoza right now? How about Jay Groome?
