He has enormous left-handed power and controls the zone. He has a fair amount of swing-and-miss (24% K% in 2024), but it's not so bad as to create scary bust risk. LaViolette's swing and approach are geared for power; he had a 23 degree average launch in 2024. He's strong enough to leave the yard from pole to pole, but most of his damage is done to the pull side. LaViolette has a low ball proclivity, and he can struggle with fastballs up and away from him, but his thump is weaponized enough by his swing plane for him to get to power even if he's striking out a lot. LaViolette also has a sneaky shot to stay in center field. He has spent time in center and right, and he looks comfortable going back on balls over his head, but his size might be a prohibitive factor as he matures and fills out. LaViolette has a star-level power-hitting center fielder ceiling.",,sa3036058

His offensive production took a bit of a hit (from a 1.089 OPS to .841), but then he crushed on Cape Cod, where he hit eight homers in 21 games. Aside from a concerning amount of chase, Aloy does at least a little bit of everything. He's a plus athlete with a plus build and arm, above-average range, and average hands. He struggles some with hot shots, but otherwise looks like a pretty clean shortstop fit. Aloy also has plus bat speed. It takes some effort to create it, but he can really swing it, and he has uncommon power for a shortstop, which he has demonstrated with wood. Aloy made a slightly below-average amount of contact in 2024, but some adjustment period from the WAC to the SEC feels natural. The chase portion was more comfortably below average and is the flimsiest part of Aloy's profile. If he can improve his plate discipline, he has a shot to go first overall, as viable shortstops who have this kind of power and also perform in the SEC are rare.",,sa3025961

He carried a 2.98 ERA across 19 games and 105.2 IP last season, posting 159 strikeouts, 26 walks, and a 1.10 WHIP. Arnold is a super long-levered 6-foot-1 or so, but he generates 6-foot-4 extension with a deep, cross-bodied stride; his release height is a shade under four-and-a-half feet, with huge uphill angle. His arm stroke and slot are in the Madison Bumgarner area, and he boasts mechanical grace and fluidity commensurate with a starter. Arnold posted a plus-plus fastball CSW% in 2024; he sat in the low-to-mid-90s at FSU, then was more comfortably in the mid-90s during the summer of 2024 with Team USA. If you're a left-handed hitter, this is a Freddy Krueger slider. It starts in the middle of the lefty batter's box and finishes on the plate, or bends from the middle of the plate into the righty batter's box. This is rare velocity for a low-slot guy's slider, 94-97 mph. Arnold mixes in his changeup sparingly — it's not very good right now — and there's a chance he will need something like a cutter or splitter eventually because arm actions this long don't always yield changeup growth. It makes Arnold a little less stable than the typical mid-first round college pitching prospect, but he comfortably projects to have two plus or better pitches. He has a rare sort of funky athleticism and great long-term physical projection.",,sa3026225

Bremner has a backspinning downhill fastball, and might benefit from a change in stride length or direction to create a flatter angle. He sat 95 during the 2024 college season and then 96 during the summer with Team USA. He also features a two-plane, bat-missing slider with tight, hard spin and uncommon velocity (85-88 mph) for a pitch with above-average length. Bremner's best pitch might be his low-80s changeup, which he pronates over top of to create sinking action. There are stretches where his arm slot drops when he's throwing the cambio, but you can go crazy projecting on that pitch because of his fluidity and arm speed. Both the slider and changeup generated plus rates of chase and miss in 2024. He's a high-floored fourth starter prospect and has a good shot to be the first player from this draft to debut, very likely a top 10 pick.",,sa3027644

Cunningham has very special feel to hit and surprising power for his size. He has surprising speed, too; he ran some 4.15s and 4.4s with the turn last summer. It's tough to find a body comp here, but Alex Bregman is close; Washington's Luis García Jr. has a similar build, but is six inches taller. Limited arm strength relegates him to second base, but unless Cunningham's build goes the way of Willie Calhoun's (also 5-foot-8) and robs from his mobility, he's going to hit enough that it won't matter where he plays.",,

The visual evaluation of his hit tool is good, but not <em>that</em> good. His hands often trigger late, leading to suboptimal contact. Curley has strength and verve in his wrists; he can pull pitches that would jam a lot of other hitters, and he bangs hanging breakers with power. He projects to have all-fields game power at maturity. He isn't an especially rangy shortstop, and his hands are below-average, but holy cow, does Curley have monster arm strength, especially moving right to left. Poor hands follow you around to whatever position, though; it's not like Curley would be a plus third baseman if he can't play shortstop because he's too flub-prone.

He has plus raw power right now and still has room for strength on his gigantic frame. There are some alarming, pause-giving indicators here. Holliday is very often late getting to pitches on the outer third of the zone. His swing is super long and makes it tough for Holliday to pull fastballs at all, which is a red flag at this level. He struck out a lot on the showcase circuit, posting a pretty scary swinging strike rate, with more whiffs than balls in play. Despite his raw power, Ethan hasn't slugged on the showcase circuit. Per Synergy, Holliday hit .246/.446/.346 combined in 2023 and 2024 against his most talented peers. He's also likely to move off shortstop. At his present size, he is on the edge of what is typical/viable at shortstop, and Holliday likely isn't done growing. He played a lot of third with Team USA, and his performance there was a mixed bag. He's a smooth, graceful defender who bends well for his size and has above-average feet, but below-average range and hands. Still, he's new to the position, and should be fine there with reps. This is rare raw power for a lefty-hitting infielder, but Holliday's swing-and-miss issues and a future corner fit on defense create a ton of risk. Holliday is a toolsy, high-variance high school prospect with big enough ceiling to come off the board inside the top 10, like Elijah Green and Benny Montgomery did despite their risk.",WZgskP3vFPQ,

He often sits in the mid-to-upper-90s and will touch 100. Hernandez has a strapping 6-foot-4 QB frame with room for more strength. He also has ridiculous arm speed. His fastball is frustratingly vulnerable due to inconsistent movement and location; the former needs to be ironed out proactively upon entry to pro ball. His pronator-style changeup has huge tailing action and plus-plus potential thanks to Hernandez's arm speed. The slider is less consistent and vulnerable when it isn't good; it's mostly 82-85 with two-plane wipe, but the best ones are plus. Hernandez takes a great BP and makes some amazing plays at first base, which is evidence that he's an outstanding athlete who one can expect to make adjustments on the mound.

Posted a 90% in-zone contact rate in 2024 and a 105 mph EV90, both a standard deviation better than the college average. Likely to produce extra-base power, but probably not home run thump. Defensive position is unsettled. Has seen time at both middle infield spots, first base, and in center field. Runs well enough to get more center field run, but not well enough to be a lock.

He routinely gets over 20 inches of vertical break on it to go with 13 inches of horizontal break, and he generates a shallow approach angle that helps it play up even more. For a variety of reasons, college pitch metrics tend to overstate the amount of movement a pitch will have once a player gets into affiliated ball, but it’s one of the best fastballs in college baseball. Doyle uses his heater around 70% of the time, but he does have a slider and a changeup. The slider has more lateral break with hard bite, and he rips off a nice changeup with late fade.
