1,1,"Gunnar Henderson","BAL","SS","MLB",2023,"65","Med",,"22.2555555","6' 2""","210","L","R",2019,"Draft","BAL",2300000,"Morgan Academy HS (AL)","Henderson, still just the age of a college draft prospect, had one of the best offensive performances in minor league baseball in 2022 and made his big league debut late in the season. After strikeouts were an issue for him in 2021, he narrowed his approach (which is now surgically precise) and began to attack pitches he could damage, avoiding ones on the outer edge of the zone until he has no choice but to put them in play. The change made Henderson a dominant offensive force even though he continued to swing and miss at a worse-than-average rate, and he slashed .297/.416/.531 combined at Double-A Bowie and Triple-A Norfolk before being called up to Baltimore for the last month of the season. 
The offensive package, even with a bat-to-ball blemish (for now), is still befitting of a star-level talent at shortstop or third base, wherever Henderson ends up playing. He is short to the baseball and still generates huge, all-fields power, swinging with so much effort and might that sometimes his head rattles around and his helmet flies off as he's making contact. While this might contribute to some of his in-zone and overall swing-and-miss rates (he posted a 77% Z-contact% and 72% overall contact% in 2022, both comfortably below the big league average), Henderson shows plenty of hitterish traits that instill confidence in his 2022 output. He has terrific breaking ball recognition, uses his whole body to maneuver the barrel around the zone, and can let pitches travel deep before driving them the other way, and Henderson is strong enough to do damage to left field even when he's late or mis-hits a pitch. He can be beaten with high velocity more regularly than anything else, but if pitchers miss and catch too much of the meat of the zone, that mistake is going to get hit hard somewhere. Henderson's hard-hit rate (52%), average exit velocity (92 mph), max exit velo for his age (116 mph), barrel rate in the minors, and anything else that measures power and contact quality are all a 60 or 70 on the scouting scale, and so is his plate discipline. Even with a 40 or 45-grade hit tool, which feels like a low-end outcome, that's a star player at shortstop and an above-average regular at third base. 
He's a little more tightly wound than is typical for a big league shortstop, but Henderson's straight-line speed is plus and so is his defensive range, and his arm strength enables him to make some plays that many other infielders can't. His feeds around the bag sometimes lack touch and accuracy, but he's otherwise a capable shortstop defender and would easily be plus at third base. On a universal prospect continuum, Henderson grades out a shade below some of the 70 FV or better prospects from recent years like Shohei Ohtani, Wander Franco, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., and (gulp) Gavin Lux (who is now tracking like a 60, thank goodness) because we're talking about a corner bat with what might be a 45-grade hit tool. Still, he's poised to be a franchise cornerstone for the Orioles' looming renaissance.","NyW9Bnc86CI","26289"
2,1,"Corbin Carroll","ARI","LF","MLB",2023,"65","Med",,"23.1111111","5' 10""","165","L","L",2019,"Draft","ARI",3745500,"Lakeside HS (WA)","For players written up as Imminent Big Leaguers, the late-cycle list blurbs have taken on more of a reflective tone, a chance to check in on how things are going compared to the earlier report. They're almost easier to execute for players who <em>aren't</em> performing as expected, and Carroll, who signed an eight-year, $111 million extension this offseason, has been one of the best players in the majors so far this season. If anything, the fact that he was ranked as the second-best prospect in baseball behind Gunnar Henderson has been incorrect to this point. If there's one thing about Carroll that I was consistently wrong about as he traversed the minors, it was that he'd become a better center field defender than Alek Thomas. He hasn't, but it hasn't mattered. This dude is getting MVP chants at Chase Field. 
His offseason report, which follows, has been on target thus far: Just seven games into his 2021 minor league season, Carroll sustained a posterior capsular avulsion fracture and a labrum tear during a swing on which he homered. The rip was more explosive than his shoulder could handle, and part of it tore away from the bone. He spent most of the rest of the year rehabbing in Arizona, often attending Diamondbacks games in his sling. This isn't a common injury and the industry wasn't quite sure what to make of its impact on his trajectory. There was some worry that Carroll wouldn't be quite the same player when he returned, but he quickly allayed those concerns by dominating the upper minors as soon as the 2022 starter pistol fired, notching an amazing 53 extra-base hits in just 91 Double- and Triple-A games before he slashed .260/.330/.500 during a September big league call-up. 
Carroll has evolved in some surprising ways as a hitter. His amateur look was that of a slash-and-dash leadoff man with doubles power and a great idea of the strike zone. While some of those skills are still bricks in Carroll's baseball-playing foundation, he has developed much more power than even the most optimistic amateur projections. His forearms have grown like the Grinch's heart, and Carroll can now bang wall-threatening contact to all fields with the flick of his wrists. The compact nature of Carroll's body and swing gives him a little extra time and distance to diagnose pitches, and his strength makes him a threat to do damage on the ones that he lets travel deep into the hitting zone. He rarely chases and spoils lots of well-executed pitches, grinding away at opposing pitchers. Because Carroll runs such deep counts, his strikeout rates have been higher than one might expect given his reputation as a plus contact hitter. He did show some swing-and-miss vulnerability at the top of the strike zone throughout 2022, but seemed to be remedying that toward the end of the season. 
He's a complete hitter who will likely produce some 25-30 home run seasons by virtue of his contact quality and frequency, as well as some .400-plus OBP seasons because of his plate discipline and speed. And Carroll can really motor: he's a no-doubt 80 runner and routinely posts sub-4.00 second times to first base. His speed makes him a defensive fit in center field but a lack of arm strength and the presence of young Alek Thomas in Arizona will likely push Carroll to left (he's played a mix of left, center, and right in 2023), where he might be the game's rangiest defender at that position. Poised to make an immediate impact as Arizona's leadoff hitter, Carroll is the tip of the spear the Diamondbacks are pointing at the Dodgers and Padres.","sUghxoNDJ4g","25878"
1,1,"Elly De La Cruz","CIN","SS","MLB",2024,"60","High",,"21.7222222","6' 5""","200","S","R",2018,"J2","CIN",65000,"Dominican Republic","De La Cruz has the most exciting combination of tools and defensive fit in the minors, a switch-hitter with plus-plus power, speed, arm strength, and all-around athleticism, as well as a somewhat more consistent look at shortstop than he had a year ago, even at 6-foot-5. He followed up his splashy 2021 with a 2022 tidal wave, reaching Double-A Chattanooga as a 20-year-old while tabulating over 70 extra-base hits and about 40 stolen bases. He sports ridiculous all-fields power from the left side of the plate, floats from base to base with huge, graceful strides, can clock home-to-first times close to 4.00 seconds, and still has room for much, much more mass on his frame before it detracts from his mobility enough to push him off shortstop. While he could stand to be a little more consistent on defense (many balls got through him early this past winter with Licey), the range, bend, hands, and arm strength to play short are all comfortably here. 
If he does that while getting to most of his power, he'll be one of the better players in baseball... it's just that De La Cruz has struck out a concerning 30% of the time. Even at shortstop, there isn't a full-time player in the big leagues who punches out quite that often. The closest contemporary statistical predecessors and tool-based comps to make for De La Cruz are Willy Adames (a 29% K% hitter who has performed like a 60 because he gets to his power and plays great defense) and Fernando Tatis Jr. (27.6% K%). Elly's tools are big enough to stand with those guys, but if he's striking out at a 30% clip at Double-A, it's likely he'll do so more often against big league pitching, which puts him in a dangerous area. His strikeout problems stem from poor breaking ball and offspeed recognition, as he chases those pitches a fair bit (about a 40% rate against sliders and curveballs at Double-A per Synergy) while also swinging through lots of them in the zone (75% Z-Contact% versus non-fastballs). His overall chase rates remain a little worse than average but they're not terrifying. There are plenty of good players on the big league O-Swing% leaderboard, including many young stars, but these issues together create hit tool-related bust risk for Elly. Obviously he's ranked here as if he's set to become a star player anyway. Added to the 40-man roster in November, De La Cruz is on pace for regular big league playing time in 2024.","S9LlAJHlow","26668"

The Andean condor of pitching prospects, he has incredible body control and strike-throwing ability for a pitcher this young, who is this size, who throws this hard, and who has made repertoire adjustments on the fly throughout the last year and a half. Across 2021 and 2022, Pérez added about 30 pounds, experienced a two-tick fastball velocity bump, and incorporated a second, harder breaking ball that has become his primary non-fastball weapon. After sitting ""only"" 94-95 mph in 2021, he’s now parked in the 96-98 mph range for entire starts, and his hardest sliders (in the 85-87 mph range) are nearly 10 mph harder than his average curveball was in 2021 (77 mph). At one point he rose to being our no. 2 overall prospect, then was shut down for a little over a month with what Miami described as ""arm fatigue"" late in 2022. He's looked totally fine since returning, including early in 2023 when he made six dominant starts at Double-A Pensacola and was promoted to Miami. 
Pérez shows bend and balance in his lower half as he propels himself way down the mound and releases on the doorstep of the batter’s box, making hitters extremely uncomfortable. Though he doesn't throw the pitch a ton, his changeup feel is also precocious and currently more consistent than his feel for his newer slider, which tends to finish in the zone too often. The ceiling on his changeup and command are both huge. Tall, long-levered pitchers tend to sharpen their command into their 20s as they refine their control of their bodies, and Pérez already has average command at age 20. Consider that C.C. Sabathia walked a batter every other inning during his age-20 rookie season and, over time, became one of the more efficient strike-throwers in baseball with one of the game's best changeups. Pérez has similar ingredients at the same age. The sky's the limit here. It will be interesting to see how the Marlins manicure his workload in 2023 since he's only thrown 77 innings each of the last two seasons and is easily on pace to blow through that mark this year. As of the early part of 2023, Miami is scrapping around .500 and their rotation, especially with a fully-operational Eury, would make them pretty dangerous in a postseason setting if they can sneak in.","3DQ2xBgH2H8","27768"
9,1,"Anthony Volpe","NYY","2B","MLB",2023,"60","Med",,"22.425","5' 11""","180","R","R",2019,"Draft","NYY",2740300,"Delbarton HS (NJ)","Drafted as a glove-first shortstop prospect, Volpe had a uninspiring professional debut, but he totally transformed himself during the lost pandemic season and returned in 2021 with one of the best campaigns in all of the minor leagues, slugging .604 across two levels. After a slow start to 2022, Volpe hit .273/.355/.502 with Double-A Somerset from May through August and earned a late-season call up to Scranton. He's poised to start his age-22 season at Triple-A and likely make his big league debut at some point in 2023, perhaps usurping Gleyber Torres as the everyday second baseman if it becomes clear that Volpe is a superior offensive option. 
Working with a private instructor on a daily basis during the pandemic, Volpe completely re-engineered his swing, which now produces impact power, especially for a middle infielder. You've probably seen big league hitters use a ""toe tap,"" or heard broadcasters use that phrase. Well, Volpe's swing starts with what is best described as a ""heel tap"" of his rear leg, as he loads all his weight onto his back side before he strides forward and swings with verve and ferocity. The swing changes that helped enable his breakout created a bat path built to lift the ball to the extreme, and Volpe's average launch angle was a whopping 24 degrees last year. His swing is like a right-handed version of Juan Soto's, capable of getting underneath the baseball in basically every part of the zone, in part because of the flexibility and athleticism in his lower half. 
Even though he's been on a throwing program to strengthen his arm, Volpe still doesn't have the hose typical of a big league shortstop. If he had somehow improved his throwing (which isn't terrible — he could play short in an emergency), he'd still be behind Oswald Peraza and Isiah Kiner-Falefa in this regard and would end up at second base anyway. As Volpe has added strength and mass, the trunk of his body has thickened substantially and impacted his defensive mobility a bit. His second base defense could trend down as he gets deeper into his 20s, but he should be fine there for a while. Volpe's game power should routinely put him in the mix for All-Star teams for as long as he stays on the middle infield, and he'll still be a productive everyday player if he moves later in his career.","EpQrKumdH-A","27647"
10,1,"Francisco Alvarez","NYM","C","A",2023,"60","High",,"21.8666666","5' 10""","233","R","R",2018,"J2","NYM",2700000,"Venezuela","Álvarez has comfortably lived up to the hype since signing out of Venezuela in 2018 for nearly $3 million. Considered too advanced for the team’s Dominican complex, he made his stateside pro debut in 2019 and followed that up by posting a .941 OPS across two A-ball levels in 2021 while he was still a teenager. In 2022, he dominated the upper levels (.260/.374/.511) and made his big league debut at age 20 with a five-game cup of coffee. Veteran stalwarts Omar Narváez and Tomás Nido began the 2023 season ahead of him on the big league depth chart, but both catchers experienced bumps and bruises early on, which resulted in the college-aged Álvarez being recalled to the majors in early April. He was foisted into the primary catching role not long before the Mets list was published. 
If you have the opportunity to head to the ballpark early and watch Álvarez take batting practice, you should. He has had the most impressive BP session at each of the last two Futures Games, launching satellite-threatening baseballs to the very outer reaches of big league stadiums. And Álvarez wants to show you his power. He does not take casual BP hacks, he maxes out and swings with all-out effort. This extends to his in-game approach, a feature that gives some scouts pause and inspires concern that big league pitchers will pull the rug out from under him. There is some analytical fire to back up the smoke the scouts are smelling. Álvarez only ran a 75% Z-contact and 66% overall contact rate in the minors last year and has produced similarly low rates in the majors. That's near the bottom of the big league catchers' continuum and is almost identical to Joey Bart and Jorge Alfaro, both of whom have struggled to find big league footing on offense. Still, Álvarez has been 20 to 21 years old while facing Double-A pitching and above, so it's reasonable to project growth in this area. Plus, Álvarez isn't nearly as chase-prone as Alfaro and has much more power than Bart, so he should outperform both. His swing is designed for power. It has a bit of a loop and a steep plane to it, enabling him to crush mistakes to left and center field. He doesn't track pitches especially well (his head often flies all over the place) and he has mediocre barrel variability, so he's likely to swing and miss at an above-average clip in the big leagues, but he's going to get to an absurd amount of power for a catcher and produce at an All-Star offensive level for the position.
Defensively, Álvarez is still a bit of a mixed bag, but he's improved very quickly in a couple of key areas. The headline tool here is Álvarez's huge arm. He will sometimes pop below 1.80 seconds now that he's gotten better at leaving his crouch before the pitch has reached him. He's capable of making some ridiculous throws because of his athleticism and raw arm strength, but Álvarez will also botch the occasional exchange because his hands aren't great. He still tends to let low breaking balls travel too deep, making some frameable pitches look like they're comfortably below the zone. But he's gotten much better at blocking balls from the one-knee position in 2023, less often trying to use his 40-grade hands to pick everything in the dirt and more often moving laterally while maintaining a wide base to seal with his whole lower body. Álvarez receives on one knee with the bases empty and mixes his technique with runners on base. His quickness for an athlete his size is remarkable, and his style of receiving has facilitated that quickness and mobility in beneficial ways in 2023. Things are going pretty well for a 21-year-old tasked with catching the monster stuff of a contending team's pitching staff. It will probably be a while before Álvarez is banging on all cylinders, but he's holding his own as a defender and his power should keep his offensive output close to average while he adjusts to big league pitching and climbs toward premium production for the position a year or two from now.","TG-p0lUDzpM","26121"
11,1,"Jordan Walker","STL","RF","MLB",2023,"60","High",,"21.3583333","6' 5""","250","R","R",2020,"Draft","STL",2900000,"Decatur HS (GA)","Walker worked out as a pitcher, shortstop, and third baseman in high school, then had a rough draft spring amid some weight gain, which is part of why he fell deep into the first round. To say he looks like a steal is a drastic understatement at this point, as he is one of the most exciting young hitters in the minors, with elite power potential and superlative on-paper performance at Double-A throughout 2022, all while he was still not old enough to have a beer. His hot 2023 spring training led to Walker breaking camp with the big league team, and he kicked off his major league career with a record-tying 12-game hit streak. A subsequent slump on both sides of the ball led to his demotion to Memphis for adjustments and refinement, and he continued to struggle there before finding his footing in mid-May. We see this more as a developmental speed bump than a harbinger of doom and still think that if you're looking for the prospect most likely to hit 40 home runs in a season down the line, this is your player. 
Any discussion of Walker begins with his titanic power, which is already among the best in pro baseball. He has a simple, well-leveraged swing that takes advantage of his strength, and the long levers that come with his 6-foot-5, 250 pound frame produce jaw-dropping home runs when he really squares one up and plenty of wall-threatening contact when he doesn't. His approach is solid, though there are some issues chasing breaking balls and his in-zone swing-and-miss was a fair bit below average in 2022 (he swings inside a lot of sliders), but that was as a 20-year-old at Double-A.
Walker was initially developed as a third baseman, and his ability to bend and get deep into his legs, as well as his lateral agility and range, was pretty amazing for a player his size. But Walker's quick rise through the minors and Nolan Arenado's presence through 2027 dictated a move off of third base. Late in 2022, the Cardinals started giving Walker reps in the outfield, mostly in right, and he looked fine out there for someone who had just started playing there. While it was an encouraging first step and Walker still projects as a suitable defender in the outfield, he wasn't ready for the TV league and sometimes still looks uncomfortable making routine plays. His rocket arm will be a weapon in right and he should eventually be an average defender there. Even if he ends up at 1B/DH over time, Walker will hit for enough power to be a star. The speed at which Walker is able to make that level of impact is important considering many of the Cardinals' other key players are older.","zyAwB3KQByE","27475"
11,2,"Endy Rodríguez","PIT","C","MLB",2023,"55","Low",,"23.4027777","6' 0""","200","S","R",2018,"J2","NYM",10000,"Dominican Republic","As of list publication, Rodriguez is one of just two catchers on Pittsburgh's 40-man roster, and while it's possible he's beaten out by a veteran non-roster invitee like Tyler Heineman or Kevin Plawecki, Rodriguez's defensive chops and versatility give him a shot to break camp with the big club, split time with Austin Hedges, and moonlight at one or two other positions before eventually seizing the primary catcher job. Endy had an incredible 2022 statline — .323/.407/.590 — most of which was generated at hitter-friendly Greensboro. He's now a career .303/.394/.533 hitter and has had meaningful statistical success up through Double-A, where he spent about a month toward the end of 2022. 
From a heuristics standpoint, you can't do much better than Rodriguez's profile. He's a young, switch-hitting catcher with cartoonish offensive numbers (especially from a bat-to-ball standpoint) and uncommon defensive versatility, as he's played a bunch of second base and left field as well. Throw in the visual twitch and athleticism, and this is the player Spotify's algorithm would recommend to FanGraphs if prospects were musical artists. 
From the left side of the plate, Rodriguez has an exceptional ability to rip his hands through pitches on the inner edge of the zone. Out over the plate, he has a tendency to stay inside fastballs and lift them toward the opposite field gap. So compact and short to the baseball is Rodriguez that he can wait an extra beat to diagnose pitch types, which enables him to make in-flight adjustments to breaking balls, spoil the well-located ones, and crush the hangers. As a right-handed hitter almost all of Endy's damage is done on outer-third pitches that he can get fully extended against. His swing is quite uphill from the left side and he can tend to swing underneath fastballs up and away from him, but overall he is very difficult to make whiff inside the strike zone despite his steep-launch style of contact. 
On defense, Rodriguez's size is both a feature and a bug. He's naturally adept at framing low strikes because he's already so low to the ground, but it's also fair to wonder if such a small athlete can withstand the grind of catching 80-100 games every summer. Rodriguez's arm is comfortably plus. You can really see his athleticism and remarkable hip/shoulder separation on his throws down to second. His pop times are routinely in the 1.85-1.95 range in part because Endy has a strong arm, but also because he's almost always leaving his crouch before he even receives the pitch on steal attempts, which hastens his exchange. This level of athleticism might be an indication that Rodriguez will find a way to mature into more raw power despite not having a traditionally projectable frame. His swing is already geared for lift, but he doesn't currently have the raw juice to make the most of it. He's going to be a star if he ends up with even average raw power, and even if he doesn't, we're talking about a switch-hitting catcher who can make an impact on both offense and defense. He might end up becoming the player the industry hoped Francisco Mejía would become.",,"25332"

Rodriguez was quite comfortably the most dominant pitcher in the minors in 2021, when he racked up nearly three times as many strikeouts as hits allowed. As is customary for pitching prospects near the tippity top of prospect lists, Rodriguez got hurt in 2022, suffering a Grade 2 lat strain in early June. Prior to the injury, he had allowed just 48 baserunners in 56 innings and struck out 80 men. He returned three months later and labored through a rocky September with Norfolk, during which he struggled with walks. Across the season as a whole, his fastball ""only"" sat 95 mph, and in his final start of the year it was mostly in the 93-96 mph range, which is a two-tick regression from 2021, when Rodriguez sat 96-98 all year. Scouts who saw him after Labor Day thought the quality and utility of his breaking balls (while still good) had also backed up a bit. Certainly from a velocity and spin (about 200 rpm) standpoint they had, though each is still capable of missing bats. 
There is still a front-end arm here, as well as a big, sturdy-looking frame that theoretically should be able to eat a ton of innings. Rodriguez's changeup, which falls through a trap door just as it approaches the plate, is among the best secondary pitches in the minors, garnering a 42% chase and whiff rate in 2022. He can vary his breaking ball shape and will occasionally show you 88-91 mph with cut, at other times 77-83 mph with sweep. It's still quite the arsenal, it's just that the breaking balls aren't all 60s and 70s anymore, or at least they weren't at the end of 2022. On last look, it was stuff that profiled in the middle of a contending team's rotation, rather than at the very front. Rodriguez is still a major league-ready impact prospect and is a prime American League Rookie of the Year candidate. He has a shot to break camp with the big club and play a huge role on the next Orioles contender.","XVnKhGydp9Y","24492"

He hit just .211/.275/.344 in the Northwest League and his bat speed looked like it had regressed significantly compared to his electric foray into pro ball. Despite this, Matos remained tough to make swing and miss, and he ran a 16% K% last season. In part due to a quad strain and because it was his 40-man evaluation year, the Giants sent Matos to the Arizona Fall League to pick up reps and try to earn a roster spot. He didn't hit especially well in Arizona either, but the Giants weren't exactly deep with viable defensive center fielders, so they rostered Matos in the offseason. 
He has rebounded in a huge way so far in 2023 and rocketed through the upper-minors en route to a recent big league debut. Matos has always been tough to strike out, but in 2023 it's been nearly impossible, as he posted single-digit strikeout rates at Richmond and Sacramento prior to his call-up while his power also rebounded. Visual assessment of Matos' swing and his underlying data suggest the surge is real. He's still chase-prone, but his high-end exit velos are up compared to 2022, and the beautiful, 180-degree finish Matos' swing would show at peak has returned with greater frequency. Wielding one of the prettier righty swings in baseball, Matos is moving the barrel all over the zone and turning on up-and-in pitches with power again. 
His feel for center field helps him profile there despite middling speed for that position. There are some scouts who think he'll end up in a corner, but here he projects as a 50 glove in center. At minimum, we expect he'll perform similar to how Manny Margot has on offense, and Matos' ability to yank inside pitches out to his pull side should enable him to hit for more power than Margot and produce like an above-average center fielder.","80MpC-9ThE0","26467"

Most apparently, his batting stance is more upright now than it was in prior seasons. Baty has consistently been a high groundball rate hitter, at least 51% at every full-season level until his 42% 2022 mark with Double-A Binghamton, where he spent the bulk of the year. The identifiable visual tweak to the swing, the shift in batted ball profile, and Baty's dramatic uptick in home runs in 2022 are all indications that he's dialed in the details that have kept him vacillating between several FV tiers for the last couple of years. Lever length still limits Baty's ability to make consistent, quality contact in certain parts of the zone, but he still shows you impressive barrel control as he tries to get the bat where it needs to be. He's a lovely, loose rotator for a hitter his size and is willing to use the opposite field when pitches are away from him. He's still going to swing and miss at a lot of fastballs up and away from him; he is often late to this portion of the zone. He has the power to do big damage the other way when he's catching pitches out there, but he runs hot and cold in this respect. 
Baty was an older draft prospect of considerable size and there was worry he'd have to move to first base in pro ball. Though he sometimes needs an extra beat or two to get rid of the baseball, he's not only kept things in check physically but actually improved to the point of being an above-average defender. A relatively complete player, Baty has been the Mets' everyday third baseman for the better part of the last month and projects as an above-average regular.","rXT1HH8Lgkw","26123"

The righty had only made 11 career starts at then-Division-II Bellarmine University, but a successful 2019 summer on the Cape and a lights out draft spring suggested that he was a real prospect. Pfaadt pitched at 2020 instructs, then rocketed through the bottom of Arizona's system in 2021, making brief stops at both A-ball levels before closing the season with six starts at Double-A Amarillo. He then spent most of 2022 at the upper levels dominating to the tune of a 32% K% and 4% BB%. After five dominant starts with Reno to start the 2023 season, Pfaadt was called up to Phoenix and got knocked around for the better part of another five starts before being sent down. Pfaadt's breaking ball wasn't finishing consistently during his first stint in the big leagues, and his fastball command would waver as his outings wore on. 
He still has all the characteristics of a mid-rotation starter on a contender. His delivery is a bit more violent than is ideal, but pitchers who are built like Pfaadt, and who move like he does, tend to pan out over time. His fastball sits 92-95 mph and its line is tough to get on top of. He has spurts where his misses with the fastball are very small; with command refinement, this will play like a plus pitch even at average velocity. For a pitcher from Bellarmine to have three plus-flashing secondary pitches after just over two years of actual in-game reps is an impressive feat and a feather in the cap of Arizona's ops group. 
Pfaadt throws a deep, vertical mid-to-upper-70s curveball for strikes and uses his lateral slider for chase. His slider looks best when it has something more like two-plane movement, which wasn't often the case during his debut big league stint, but the pitch was still plus on occasion. Pfaadt's fading change flashes bat-missing action, but it also flattens at times, and even though Pfaadt is comfortable enough to use it against righties, it's the pitch he has the least consistent feel for locating. Again, pitchers this size tend to get better feel for their bodies in their mid-20s, when their feel becomes a little more precise and the monster stuff that has been lurking really starts to play. Despite his stale cup of coffee, there's no real change to how I have Pfaadt graded.","FMdJaWih6b8","27782"

That has been correct to this point, and Jung is having a huge season despite somewhat scary peripherals. 
His pre-season report: Jung was an elite college performer at Texas Tech — he posted a .348/.455/.577 line with more walks than strikeouts throughout his career — but didn't hit for huge home run power there, in part because he tended to work the opposite field. Of the 71 extra-base hits Synergy Sports has on tape from Jung's time at Tech, 51 were to center or right field. This cemented confidence in his feel to hit and also generated pre-draft conversations about whether there was a path for Jung to get to more power in games by pulling the ball more often, and whether that would hurt his ability to make contact. It has been tough to truly find out even though Jung is now 25 and has set foot in the big leagues. There was no 2020 post-draft minor league season, and each of Jung's last two campaigns have begun with prolonged IL stints due to severe injury. His 2021 season got off to a delayed start because of a stress fracture in his left foot (he slashed .326/.398/.592 across about 80 upper-level games thereafter), and Jung spent most of 2022 on the shelf rehabbing from surgery to repair a torn left labrum. At times Jung looked totally lost late in 2022 when he finally returned from the shoulder surgery. His propensity to chase and lunge at pitches nowhere close to the zone led to a 38% strikeout rate during his September call-up. That isn't consistent with his career performance: Jung's 2021 chase rate, per Synergy, was just 24%, and that exploded to 37% in 2022. Our interpretation of this is that it's a result of rust from the prolonged layoff rather than an actual indication that Jung suddenly has terrible feel for the strike zone. Jung is still a strong, bendy, explosive third base athlete with all-fields pop, a hit/power combination above the everyday bar at third base, and an above-average glove.","RlBShzGPoCY","26299"

Casas has enough big league at-bats to have lost rookie eligibility, so this isn't an update on his report so much as it is an early reflection on his offseason scouting report. He's hitting just north of .200 as of publication and performing at a slightly below-replacement level. While his xwOBA (about .340) indicates he's due for positive regression, that mark is still south of what's average at first base. It's likely Casas will improve as he enters his ""prime"" and gets used to facing the nastiest pitching on the planet, but when you project a hitter to be better than the average starting first baseman throughout the first half decade of his career and he starts things off with a season under replacement-level water, it's going to be tough to be right about that. ZiPS has projected Casas as more of a 45-grade player and that's closer to what I'd project now than his pre-season scouting eval. It's a reminder to take the under on 1B/DH-only athletes most of the time. 
Here is Casas' offseason report: Casas spent most of 2022 with Triple-A Worcester and hit .273/.382/.481 there amid a two-month absence due to a high ankle sprain. He debuted with Boston late in the season and flashed the titanic power that promises to make him a valuable big league regular, and also ran the high walk and strikeout rates that readers should expect from him going forward. He went to the Dominican Winter League to be part of Licey's prospect-studded lineup (Elly De La Cruz, Ronny Mauricio, and a few others were also on that roster at the start of the LIDOM season), but a knee injury ended that jaunt after just three games. While manager Alex Cora has indicated that they'll spell Casas versus the occasional lefty starter, he entered the spring poised to break camp with the big league team and put together a hot Grapefruit League performance.
A career .269/.374/.485 hitter in the minors, some front office analyst sources who provided feedback on the Top 100 list are skeptical Casas will make enough contact to profile comfortably as an above-average regular at first base. He struggles with softer stuff in the bottom of the strike zone, and his in-zone and overall contact rates in 2022 were 78% and 70% respectively, similar to Nolan Gorman, Franchy Cordero, Bobby Dalbec and others who have tantalizing power but have sometimes been frustrating big league hitters. But in Casas' case, there is <em>so much</em> power that he profiles as an above-average big league run producer at first base. Injuries and the pandemic have limited him to just 284 career minor league games since he was drafted in 2018, and his bat-to-ball skill has projection deep into his mid-20s as he continues to gain actual pro experience. The amount of power here is sensational: Casas is capable of hitting huge tanks to all parts of the ballpark, and his hard-hit rate in 2022 was a whopping 50%, which would have been top 15 among qualified big league hitters. A lumbering, heavy-bodied athlete, his injury track record is also a bit of a concern. Part of Boston's motivation to DH him sometimes and caddy for him with righty-hitting corner bats against some lefty starters is to manage his workload with this in mind. This combined with the undercooked hit tool might lead to some big league growing pains and medium production at first, but over time, Casas should become a middle-of-the-order force capable of hitting 35-plus annual homers.","7qE5xW64PYE","22514"

In totality, Miller made 24 starts (if you count his Futures Game outing), worked 113 innings and posted a top-25 K-BB% among minor leaguers who threw at least 100 frames. That's a 31% K% and 8% BB% across twice as many innings as the year before, when Miller was being built back up from the shortened 2020 season. And Miller held upper-90s velocity throughout, sitting 98-99 mph throughout most of his starts and rarely ever dipping below the 96-97 mph band with his fastball, which he also threw for a strike at a 70% clip in 2022. Despite some of the length and violence in Miller's delivery, he's demonstrated that he can sustain elite velocity deep into each start, throw strikes, and (so far) keep his arm healthy, as his only career IL stint was for an oblique strain. He's set up to throw about 135 innings in 2023 (assuming a typical 20-inning increase) and, if his annual pattern of promotion is any indication, he'll be given his first big league opportunity late this year (and push for a playoff roster spot), then compete for an Opening Day rotation job in 2024. Given the 2022 performance of some of their young 40-man occupants (strike-throwing issues for Ryan Pepiot, Andre Jackson), Miller might be Los Angeles' most reliable in-season option to make a start if one or more of their projected starters goes down with injury. 
In addition to the humming fastball, Miller wields three above-average (at least) secondary pitches that he mixes pretty evenly, especially against lefty batters. Firm, upper-80s changeups and sliders dart in different directions, and are thrown with 100 mph-looking effort. It's tough for hitters who are looking for a fastball to do anything with them, even though Miller's feel for locating his secondaries (especially his sinking changeup and low-80s curveball) is not sharp. Sheer unpredictability and velocity allow Miller to bully the strike zone without precision and still stay off barrels, while his well-executed pitches miss bats. It's possible the ceiling on Miller's curveball is big. A newer offering for him (at least based on the previous notes and data FanGraphs has), it spins at 2,900 rpm, 300 rpm more than his trademark slider. Miller's arm slot varies a little bit when he throws it, which might tip off big league hitters, but his feel for the pitch stands to improve the most of all his offerings because of its newness, which makes its raw spin rate exciting. Velocity, repertoire depth, and fastball control have Miller poised to be an impact, mid-rotation starter in the near future, while long-term secondary projection could eventually pull him into a different stratosphere.","MD0QCdaVdc","27483"

He has now thrown enough innings to graduate and, as Grayson Rodriguez and Brandon Pfaadt have struggled, you can make a pretty good case (at this stage anyway) that Brown should have been the second-ranked pitching prospect in baseball this offseason after Eury Pérez. Brown's fastball control has progressed substantially since last year (hell, just since spring training), enough that no matter how healthy the other Houston starters are come playoff time, this guy isn't getting squeezed out of their playoff rotation if the Astros make it. 
Here is his original report: Brown is the Mewtwo of pitchers, engineered as a facsimile of another powerful entity using science and technology. Drafted out of Wayne State, a Division-II school in Michigan, Brown’s arm strength and velocity have been sculpted to replicate the power-pitching formula in Houston. Readers have probably seen the side-by-side mechanical comparisons of Brown and Justin Verlander, and took notice of Brown’s overpowering stuff during his brief 2022 big league debut. Brown’s stuff was already good at Wayne, and it leveled up pretty quickly after he signed, but it was the strike throwing that took a step forward in 2022 and led to his September call-up. He’s remained at the big league level ever since, and has maintained his ability to throw strikes consistently, improving on both his walk and strikeout rates. Make no mistake, Brown does not suddenly have Verlander’s command. In fact, his fastball locations are still pretty scattered and his delivery remains quite violent. But Brown’s fastball has the sort of action that gives pitchers margin for error in the strike zone, and his stuff is so nasty that he can be imprecise and still beat hitters. Combine that with your standard issue Astros breaking ball complement (a hard, 90-mph cutter/slider and a slower knuckle curveball) and you very likely have an impact big league arm, if a somewhat inefficient one.","5MgGCrFaaYU","25880"

He did not hit well after the injury, but that's typical of hitters coming off a wrist fracture, and a second IL stint due to the wrist was an indication that it was bothering Davis throughout the year. A core scouting rule of thumb is to take the long view with catchers who have impact offensive potential. M.J. Melendez's 2019 and Bo Naylor's 2020 are recent examples of otherwise good-hitting catchers who had a terrible offensive season in the mid-minors followed by an immediate and significant rebound the following year. The bumps and bruises suffered from catching can sometimes level players for whole seasons, and Davis had a lot of them in 2022. He practically straddles the plate and was hit by 20 pitches during an injury-shortened regular season, then was somehow beaned seven more times in just 17 Arizona Fall League games. Across the 2022 calendar, Davis had nearly as many HBPs as he did extra-base hits, to which the wrist fracture likely contributed. Davis' plate crowding helps enable his pull-heavy approach. He has the strength to do damage the other way, but save for the occasional pitch on the outer edge, he's geared to pull. Big league sliders might force Davis to make an adjustment, but so far his contact performance has been solidly average. Even if sliders are a chronic issue for Davis, he'll likely still get to enough power to produce better than the average everyday catcher. 
He's not a great defender right now, and probably won't ever be better than a 40-grade glove, but Davis frames high strikes well and has plus raw arm strength. His footwork on throws to second is clunky and variable, which often impacts his throw times and accuracy, but the pure arm strength is in there. You can see the power and athleticism in Davis' lower half throughout other aspects of his game, and it's an indication that he has the ability to polish this stuff up and control the running game. With Endy Rodriguez around, it may not matter a ton. Even though both Davis and Rodriguez are near-ready catching prospects, they aren't redundant, and in fact they complement each other well. Both can be in the lineup every night because of Rodriguez's defensive versatility and the universal DH, and a more liberal timeshare behind the plate might help keep them both healthier and more consistently productive on offense. Davis' skills and offensive style are tailored like those of Evan Gattis.","2oe5V5YlQkE","29617"

Bradley has, and he's done so while building an innings count that should help vault him into the Rays rotation at some point in 2023. He only averaged 91-94 mph during the 2019 season, but he has been parked in the 94-97 range since that '20 instructs period. His pitch efficiency has been ludicrous and actually got better in 2022, when he walked just 6% of opposing batters. Bradley hammers the zone with his heater (he threw strikes with his fastball at a 71% clip in 2022), and the uphill line and carry on the pitch make it difficult for hitters to get on top of, especially at these velocities. His slider often has curt, unspectacular-looking movement, but Bradley's command of it and the way he sets it up with well-located fastballs make it a dominant pitch. He's adept at dropping it into the top of the strike zone, around the hands of left-handed hitters who think it's a fastball above the zone until it cuts down onto the corner. These two pitches are Bradley's most-used weapons by a wide margin, as his splitter and curveball are both used 6-7% of the time. Because his delivery is so elegant and consistent, Bradley's splitter has deep projection. Yes, he's reached Triple-A, but this is a 21-year-old we're talking about here. He's likely to develop feel for that pitch over time and have a more complete arsenal at peak. His fastball's underlying traits will make his current style of pitching effective at the big league level, and Bradley's demonstrated durability and command mean he's going to consume a ton of innings and have some years where he's one of baseball's top 25 or so starters from a WAR standpoint even if that splitter is only ever okay.","VcMdLgTQ9R8","22543"

The rest of the year was split relatively evenly between the two defensive roles, and the same is true so far in 2023, but the first base transition has long been seen as a possibility, maybe even an obvious move, due both to Soderstrom's below-average defense as a backstop and as a way of protecting his offensive performance from the dings that are part and parcel with everyday catching. His blocking in particular is flawed. Soderstrom's crouch is quite upright at times, creating a big five-hole, and he isn't particularly keen on throwing his body in front of short hops, opting instead to pick them with his glove. This results in more passed balls and dropped third strikes that allow runners to reach than is typical. His receiving skills have gotten better and Soderstrom's throws to second are fairly accurate and hover around two seconds, but his performance as a basepath protector has been lackluster, with a sub-20% caught-stealing rate. It seems inevitable that he'll be a full-time first baseman in the long run. 
And that's okay, because Soderstrom should hit for enough power to be an impact first baseman. He's had a nearly 50% hard-hit rate in both 2022 and 2023, and he swatted 29 homers last year and is on pace for more than that this season as a college-aged hitter at Triple-A. Soderstrom has widened and opened up his stance since the start of his professional career. Instead of a short stride toward the mound, his step is toward the plate as he closes his stance before his hips fire and he muscles the barrel through the zone. Soderstrom has some vulnerability to back foot breaking balls and he weirdly tends to muscle some up-and-in pitches the other way, but he's strong enough to do damage even when making sub-optimal contact. 
So far in 2023, he’s maintained or improved on many of his mouth-watering underlying metrics, but it’s come with a ballooning chase rate of over 40%, which is both concerning and largely to blame for his below-average performance at Triple-A. His chasing runs the gamut from below-the-zone breaking balls to heaters up at his eyebrows, and he’s swinging at 53% of the pitches he sees, far more than the major league or Triple-A average. Soderstrom's aggressive approach may lead him to have a merely average hit tool even though his barrel feel is quite good, and that seems more likely as of his first few months of 2023. He’s still slugging a good amount, but his overall hitting has ebbed. Ultimately, because he has 70 power and actualized in-zone contact, Soderstrom projects as a middle-of-the-order anchor who hits 50 annual doubles at peak. He could probably reach the majors while Oakland is still the final destination for minor leaguers in this system, especially if the org cuts bait on him catching. But with a 2024 40-man timeline and no window of contention in sight, the A's has incentive to slow play his development and hope he can actually catch.","Wxi0H5ZxDhI","27467"

The Top 100 and archived international prospect lists have more detail on his NPB track record than this blurb does, so readers should check those out if they're interested in that, but the meat of his report was as follows: Senga's fastball sits 96 mph and will touch as high as 102, though he typically tops out at 99 in any given start. Even though premium velocity is relatively rare in Japan, Senga’s fastball doesn't play like a premium pitch due to its shape and angle. In fact, his dastardly mid-80s splitter, which falls off the table and finishes below the strike zone, is easily his best offering, garnering twice as many swings and misses as his fastball in 2022, and about as many whiffs as the rest of his many pitches combined. Those pitches (in order of usage) are a cutter, slider, and the occasional curveball, all bending in anywhere between 94 and 75 mph, with the slider’s shape and velo sometimes bleeding into the other two. While his breaking ball command is inconsistent, Senga’s velocity, splitter, repertoire depth, and demonstrated durability make him a fit as no. 3 or 4 starter on a contender. 
In his early big league starts, Senga has posted an ERA and FIP around 4.00. His splitter is the only one of his offerings generating a better-than-average swinging strike rate, and Senga has leaned heavily on his cutter as a strike-garnering pitch while tending to use his fastball above the zone as a chase pitch. His fastball's lack of in-zone playability is a big reason why he's had an elevated walk rate. On five days rest for each of his starts, Senga's velocity had been trending down approaching list publication. His rest-of-season ZiPS and Steamer projections have him on pace for a 2-WAR season (exactly a 50), while THE BAT is a little more bearish and thinks Senga is a fifth starter. Barring the velo continuing to slip as a result of him having one fewer day of rest between starts than is typical in Japan, Senga is tracking in line with his offseason assessment.","thrygel4xzs","31838"

He performed well during a September call-up to New York, posting a BABIP-aided .306/.404/.429 line in 18 games. It was enough for the Yankees to roster him for their postseason series against Houston, who worked Peraza with sink and breaking balls in the bottom of the zone, which he consistently swung over the top of. His swing is geared for pull-side damage. He loads his hands high and cuts down at the ball, which makes him tough to beat in the upper two thirds of the strike zone because Peraza is so short to those locations. However, this type of swing also makes it tough to scoop underneath low pitches. Peraza seems to realize this and tends to let strikes in the lower third of the zone go by until he absolutely has to swing at them. His ability to do this consistently is surprising considering that Peraza is a fairly aggressive hitter in general, likely to run OBPs in the .310-.320 range. 
Peraza's true carrying tool is his shortstop defense. He is sure-handed and slick, twitchy and acrobatic, wielding plus range, hands, actions and arm strength. His internal clock is precise and allows him to make fundamentally uncompromised throws to first with confidence because he knows he's going to beat the runner there. He is quite comfortably the best defensive shortstop on the Yankees 40-man entering the 2023 season and likely to play there every day in the near future, producing on par with an average regular at the position.",,"22823"

That report is here: A skilled but impatient hitter who can really pick it, Tovar is poised to be the Rockies' everyday shortstop and probably will be for a while. He has incredible defensive range, especially to his right, and his footwork around the bag is balletic. At times he's too bold and rushes throws that he should just holster, but Tovar is only the age of a college draft prospect, so details like this will likely tighten up as he matures. 
The area where it's most imperative for Tovar to show improvement is his plate discipline. His fantastic bat-to-ball skills have enabled him to rake in the minors, but he has a tendency to offer at pitches that are way, way off the plate, pitches most hitters instantly know aren't competitive. He chased at a 37% rate in 2022, which isn't terrible in a big league context but is pretty bad when viewed through the minor league lens, where fewer pitchers have chase-inducing stuff. While his ball/strike recognition isn't good, Tovar is otherwise an advanced hitter. He tends to work contact to center and right field, especially against fastballs, and he has a clear two-strike approach where he ditches his leg kick and takes a more conservative swing. It will be interesting to see how Tovar's speed helps inflate his extra-base output in Coors Field; he might end up turning a lot of doubles into triples there. If not for the risk created by Tovar's plate discipline, he'd be in the 55 FV tier, as he's otherwise about to produce like a complete up-the-middle player.","MKyRxjI7PH4","24064"

Though he lacked present power and typical frame-based power projection, there was enthusiasm surrounding Frelick's catalytic offensive qualities. Hope that his many late-bloomer characteristics (multi-sport, Northeast background, reps lost due to a 2019 knee surgery and then the pandemic) would lead to an eventual breakout in the power department buoyed his draft stock into the middle of the first round. 
While the power breakout hasn't materialized yet (and feels unlikely at this point — Frelick isn't a big hip/shoulder separation athlete), Frelick ripped through three minor league levels in 2022, his first full pro season, and ended with a very strong 46-game jaunt at Triple-A Nashville, where he slashed .365/.435/.508 and walked more than he struck out; his peripherals actually improved with each promotion. Because fate was cruel to his playing time in college, his pro data sample is already much bigger than his college one, which has helped reveal that he has premium feel for the strike zone. Short levers enable Frelick to turn on inner-third fastballs and let him spray or spoil pitches that travel deep into the hitting zone, making him very tough to strike out. Frelick's style of hitting should enable doubles (and some triples) pop, but there isn't likely to be any kind of over-the-fence power here, so little that one could argue Frelick belongs south of the 50 FV tier even if he were a lock to stay in center field. He has the speed to play out there, but Frelick is not a crisp center fielder, and later in the 2022 season he saw lots of time in left (though some of it was due to the sudden presence of Esteury Ruiz), where he also looked tentative. The area in which it's most important for him to show late growth is on defense. This guy hasn't had a clear defensive home for much of his life as a prospect. There was a stretch as an amateur when Frelick was viewed as a potential second baseman, an experiment that didn't really go anywhere. Those aforementioned late-bloomer traits are a reason to think Frelick might develop in center field and turn into a Brandon Nimmo-type player, and that possibility is why he moved onto the Top 100 this offseason.

He was initially evaluated as a plus-hitting middle infielder who wasn't a lock to stay at shortstop. The Diamondbacks liked his bat enough to take him in the 2018 first round when he was coming out of high school, but McLain didn't sign, instead going to UCLA with the hope that he'd hit enough over the next few years to be drafted even higher, which he was. 
In 2022, McLain's profile did a 180 — he became more or less a slam dunk shortstop with a power-over-hit offensive skill set. McLain struck out more in 2022 than he did in his entire college career, but he also hit more home runs. His underlying contact quality and batted ball data suggested that the power output was for real (a low 31% groundball rate, a barrel rate already above what is typical for a starting big league shortstop), but he was also producing at a roughly 35-grade contact rate and getting worked by fastballs up around his hands. All of this was enough to alter the way we thought about McLain's skill set after a full season and Fall League evaluation in 2022. 
He made some adjustments coming out of the gate in 2023, utilizing a more open stance and a more dynamic stride direction. McLain is now landing with his front side open when he identifies the up-and-in fastballs that gave him trouble in 2022. He seems better able to tuck his hands in and pull pitches there than he did last season, and his in-zone contact rates are now more of a 45 on the scouting scale. He also looks thicker and stronger in the arms than he did last year, and his high-end exit velos have taken a little leap, so he also may have added a half grade or so of power. He was already likely to get to power in games because of how lift-driven his swing is, and now McLain looks even more dangerous. He now grades out like a plug-and-play everyday shortstop the likes of which we tend to value close to the middle of the Top 100 list.","IXThr8N29kc","29695"

His pre-trade numbers (.275/.392/.496 at hitter-friendly Reading) were impressive and only improved when he joined Rocket City: In his 29 games with the Angels’ Double-A affiliate, O’Hoppe slashed .306/.473/.673 and walked more than he struck out, good for a 194 wRC+ over that span. He was skipped over Triple-A and promoted straight to the majors for a five-game cup of coffee at the end of 2022, and played so well during 2023 spring training that he broke camp as the big club's primary catcher. After 16 games, during which he slashed a robust .283/.339/.547, an incredible two-week line for a 23-year-old rookie catcher, O'Hoppe suffered a torn left labrum that will keep him until at least late August.
Healthy O'Hoppe has a pull-heavy style of hitting that works for him, as just about all of his impact contact comes against inner-third pitches that he can open up on and yank to left field. Aside from his arm, which was curiously poor in 2023 and ran counter to our past notes, O'Hoppe's defense is very advanced and projects to plus. His pop times hovered around 2.10 before his injury (it's his left shoulder), but his mobility, ball-blocking, receiving and framing are all excellent, and this defensive competence is a big part of why he broke camp with the big club. He'll be the Angels primary catcher for the next half decade.","lzXOSOalbng","24729"

After the Reds gave him some time at first base in 2022, Steer now has experience at all four infield positions. He sometimes struggles with arm accuracy from third base and has sub-par range at second, but his footwork, hands, and actions keep him afloat at each spot. Cincinnati's present roster situation funnels him to third base, but Jonathan India's injury history, Joey Votto's age and handedness, and the Reds' willingness to play Kyle Farmer at shortstop in the past likely mean that Steer will see time all over the infield throughout the next few years, and this flexibility along with his hitting skill should make him nearly an everyday, every-inning player despite some of his defensive blemishes. 
The bat is Steer's carrying tool and has been since his days at Oregon. The addition of a leg kick in 2021 increased his power output without disrupting his timing at the plate, and now Steer has a well-rounded hit/patience/power toolkit that would profile in a 50 FV capacity at any non-first base position. He has some vulnerability to high fastballs and tends to do most of his extra-base damage against middle-middle mistakes, but Steer is capable of making line drive contact in basically all parts of the strike zone, and is especially adept at poking outer-third pitches the opposite way for base hits. He's a good hitter who will stabilize an infield spot in Cincinnati for the next half decade or so.",,"26323"

He was coming off a putrid 2021 in which he hit just .188, the first severe offensive struggles of a career that, to that point, had been all about offensive performance. In a 2022 split evenly between Double-A Akron and Triple-A Columbus, he slashed an impressive .263/.392/.496 with 21 homers and 20 steals, walking nearly as much as he struck out while with the Rubber Ducks. To call Naylor's 2022 a return to form isn't exactly correct, however, because much of his resurgence was due to swing alterations that made his bat path a little more variable, which he outlined in an <a href=""https://blogs.fangraphs.com/clevelands-bo-naylor-has-a-new-swing-and-a-unique-profile/"" target=""_blank"">interview with our own David Laurila</a>. There are still visual and underlying statistical indications that Naylor is going to end up with a below-average hit tool (his swing is so uphill that he'll almost certainly be vulnerable to whiffs in the strike zone), but he has very impressive bat speed and power (especially for a catcher) that is weaponized by his selective approach, which targets the up-and-in quadrant of the zone. Naylor's speed is also rare for a catcher. His stolen base total itself is not an indication of speed, but Naylor is running home-to-first as fast as 4.10, which is a plus run time, and he should swipe double-digit bases in his physical prime, relevant for fantasy-playing readers.
Naylor's defense is still pretty rough around the edges. He's an okay receiver and framer, catching on one knee with the bases empty, utilizing a traditional crouch with two strikes and with runners on base. He sometimes sets up to block breaking balls too quickly, tipping off baserunners and peeking hitters to what's coming. The lateral agility to block pitches in the dirt is obviously here, though Naylor is sometimes late getting to the ground. His 2022 throwing was not quite as good as previous notes indicate, with lots of one-hoppers to the bag or throws sailing on him, though Naylor's pop times remain close to average. These are things that need some developmental love before Naylor can assume the primary catching role in Cleveland, but he's young and athletic enough to project that they'll be worthy of that mantle relatively soon. Cleveland added him to their 40-man toward the end of last year but never optioned him, which means he still has three option years left for those defensive skills to percolate. There's no present danger that he needs to revisit third base (which he played plenty of in high school and early in pro ball) or anything like that, and Naylor continues to project as a 2-WAR primary catcher.","4SxNI1qCt10","21865"

His feel for contact has been lauded since he first entered pro ball, while his defensive ability at third and his middling power have kept him in more of a ""high probability role player"" bucket here at FanGraphs than in a star-level FV tier despite his on-paper performance. 
This is not to denigrate Vargas' skill as a hitter, as he has incredible hand-eye coordination, terrific breaking ball recognition, and a great idea of the strike zone, the complement of skills that drive his profile. He's also worked to make himself more lithe and athletic since first arriving on the Dodgers' backfields shortly after he signed, when Dodgers coaches were asking a fresh-faced Vargas to make mid-game swing-changes that incorporated more movement into his conservative cut. Vargas doesn't have the sort of projectable, statuesque frame typical of a hitter in his early 20s, and despite the relevant changes to his swing, he still isn't an especially electric athlete and the cement appears quite dry on his physique, so there's not much reason to project on his raw power going forward. The league-wide statistical standard at third base is very high right now due to the depth of excellent players at the top of that position group, and when you compare Vargas' tools and underlying data to what constitutes an average regular at the hot corner, he tends to hover around average in terms of both contact quality and frequency, and a little below when it comes to high-end power, which is consistent with his visual evaluation. Fold below-average third base defense into that picture and while Vargas is going to be a doubles machine and productive big league player, he is probably not a star. 
Even with Justin Turner's departure, the Dodgers are better equipped at third base than they are in the outfield, so Vargas is poised to see time at second base and in left field in 2023. He has very little experience at second and looked okay making routine plays there during the few reps he got in 2022, but it's tough to project him there full-time based on how his range, hands, and actions look at third. The offensive bar in left is at roughly the same level as third base and if we project Vargas to be able to play a neutral left field (he's below average right now but looks better than he ever has at third), it actually buoys his overall profile because his third base defense was pulling it down. In that case, we're talking about a rock solid everyday player in the Mark Canha mold, and in fact Vargas' career has tracked in a similar fashion, especially as we stand on the precipice of a likely position change.

He checks the talent and proximity boxes rather emphatically, and when you start lining up the other pitchers toward the back of the Top 100 list, Williams' past and theoretical future injuries are more palatable than lots of other prospects actual injuries, so we've bumped him into this tier as a correction. He dealt with a litany of issues as an amateur, as benign as a fractured finger and as severe as back issues that had some teams drop him from their draft boards. The progress Williams made at ECU amid these issues (some of which date back to high school) was remarkable. He worked in the 89-93 mph range as a high schooler, then exploded in college, hitting 100 mph as a freshman and sustaining upper-90s velocity when he finally moved to the rotation as a fourth-year junior in 2021. He was sitting 95-99 mph throughout entire outings, and punched out at least eight hitters in each of his final 11 starts, culminating in a 13 K postseason outing against Vanderbilt when his stock reached its pinnacle. While there were some pre-draft industry concerns about the balky back, Williams' innings-eating frame, his intense on-mound presence, and the ferocity of his stuff made him a slam dunk first round prospect. His slider execution is especially consistent, though his curveball has the more visually pleasing movement. Increased changeup emphasis, which was already evident during Williams' first instructs, has occurred in pro ball, and while Williams' meal ticket is still his mid-90s fastball, which he rips past hitters at the letters, he has three viable weapons right now and might have a fourth as his changeup develops. It's a mid-rotation starter's stuff, and healthy Williams should produce as such at the big league level, though the pitchers who tend to get hurt are the ones who have been hurt in the past, and there's enough of a track record here to alter how Williams lines up with similarly talented peers.","fONTT3nsNE0","30122"

When we put together the lengthy Giants Imminent Big Leaguers piece, Bailey was not included, as we didn't anticipate he'd spend just two weeks each at Richmond and Sacramento before the club decided to insert him as their primary big league catcher. 
Bailey has hit the ground running in about a month and a half of big league time and looks very much like the catcher of the present and future on a surging club. He is a skilled one-knee'd receiver, great at beating the pitch to the spot in all parts of the zone, often subtly shifting his body to help him receive borderline pitches with strike-stealing stillness. His arm stroke is unique, as Bailey often throws with a nearly sidearm angle and sometimes drops down even lower than that. It looks the way a lot of pitchers do when they're throwing their final warm-up pitch. Sometimes it can be tough for Bailey to get clear of hitters in the lefty batter's box, but for the most part, this atypical style of throwing works for him. His big league pop times are averaging just below 1.90 as of list publication, and he's accurate despite imparting tail on all his throws. Offensively, Bailey sprays all-fields contact as a lefty and is more of a pull-side ambush hitter as a righty, both of which have been the case since college. Pitchers can work away from him to limit the damage he does, but Bailey's overall offensive output is comfortably above the everyday bar at catcher and could be top 10 at the position during his peak. He's likely to be a rock solid primary catcher for the next half decade or so.","ldboN8kgvRU","27478"

He began the 2023 season on the big league roster after making his debut last September, and has been the team's backup catcher and occasional 1B/DH. While he hasn't accumulated enough at-bats to graduate from rookie status, he has accumulated enough active days on the roster. There's no change to Diaz's scouting report from the offseason — things are tracking as expected here and he projects as a primary catcher. 
Here's the text of his original report: Diaz has plus, all-fields power and covers the outer third of the plate especially well. Even while being a relatively free swinger, he's only struck out at a 15-17% clip since entering full-season ball and has a rare hit/power combination for a catcher, though he has been a little bit older for each level. A stiff, upright hitter, Diaz might have some issues with fastballs running in on his hands at the big league level, as he tended to be late on the ones he saw at Double- and Triple-A, driving them almost exclusively to the opposite field. He's only been able to pull breaking balls that don't quite finish. It's part of why he's projected with a below-average hit tool here even though he's performed at an above-average clip in the minors. 
Diaz is a viable defensive backstop, but he hasn't ever had to deal with the grind of a full season back there, peaking at 51 starts at catcher in 2021. He has also seen a lot of time at first base and, more recently, a little bit in the outfield corners. He receives on one knee with the bases empty before utilizing a traditional crouch with runners on, and he's an acceptable receiver and ball-blocker with a plus arm that plays down due to a slow exchange. Because he's a bit stiff, it's possible the grind of a full-season will impact his defensive mobility and even his offense if he has to catch 80-plus games. With Martín Maldonado and Korey Lee around, Diaz will be able to ease into the everyday waters and start some games at 1B/DH to get his bat in the lineup. Big-bodied catchers with potent bats, like Travis d'Arnaud, Tyler Flowers and Diaz, are the sorts who tend to take a leap later in their 20s, which is the expectation here.",,"23003"

After coasting through the lower levels of the minors, Lewis hit some speed bumps in 2019, rebounded in the Fall League, and then proceeded to miss most of the next three seasons because of the pandemic and two ACL tears. He began to play again in extended spring games at the end of April 2023 and rehabbed for just a few weeks before rejoining the big league team just before Twins list publication. 
Recall that Lewis basically hasn't played for three years and that when we last saw him, there were still several aspects of his profile that weren't settled. His swing has often morphed to try to keep Lewis on time without detracting too much from his athleticism and manage his strikeouts without neutering his power. His current swing looks like it did in 2022, designed to do a lot of dead-pull damage. He's going to strike out a lot but Lewis will also generate big power on contact, and while he's mostly doing it to his pull side, he is dangerous all over the zone and will occasionally get extended and laser an outer edge pitch the other way. 
Also remember that when we last saw Royce consistently, he was not a lock to remain at shortstop. The Twins had him playing only short until 2022, when he was suddenly thrust into three other positions (left field, center field, third base), then he was pressed into big league duty in center after he had played just two minor league games there. Lewis re-tore his ACL making a play at the wall in his third big league inning. He saw time at both shortstop and third base while rehabbing, and the Twins current roster situation means they need him to play third right now. His arm stroke is atypical and deliberate, and he one-hops throws to first pretty often, but Lewis tends to find a way to use his brand of effort and athleticism to make plays, including some highlight reel ones. Lauded for his effort and affability, the combination of Lewis' makeup and athleticism kept him firmly entrenched among the Top 100 even while he was hurt for long stretches of time. He's back and ready to make an immediate impact on Minnesota's playoff push, likely playing a valuable multi-positional role that has him in the lineup every day throughout the course of his career.","38ioTNwWePc","20437"

He matriculated to Florida Atlantic, where the Owls considered him athletic enough to deploy as a two-way player during his freshman season before he focused more on pitching in 2019 and 2020. Allen sat 88-90 again as a junior and then, like many Cleveland pitching prospects, enjoyed a two-tick bump pretty quickly, sitting 90-93 throughout his first full season in pro ball, a velocity he maintained across 110 innings, many more than he had thrown during the pandemic-shortened year. That continued in 2022 when Allen reached Triple-A and put himself in position to claim a rotation spot this season should the need arise. 
His split/changeup is still his best pitch, but Allen has undergone a stylistic change and now takes a power pitcher's approach with his fastball, ripping it past hitters at the letters with a high-effort delivery despite its mediocre velocity. Allen's fastball has other traits that help it punch above its weight, and he commands it with machine-like regularity to the locations in which it is most effective. He's short, he gets way down the mound (which helps create shallow angle on the pitch), and even though he has a three-quarters arm slot, his hand position is more north/south on release, which helps him create backspin and ride on the fastball. It plays as an above-average offering even though Allen's raw arm strength is comfortably below average. His split/changeup (it only has about 1,300 rpm of spin, definitely in split territory) has plus sinking action, but the direction of its lateral movement is highly variable. At times, it has typical sink and tail; at others, it has sink and careens toward Allen's glove side like a slider. Speaking of the slider, Allen's has gotten much better in pro ball. His arm angle makes it naturally tough on lefties but its utility is limited against righties, which is likely what caused Cleveland and Allen to work on a cutter that is still in the nascent stages of development. Lefties with plus command and plus changeups tend to overachieve and Allen is exactly that, poised to play a mid-rotation role relatively soon.","5zHaWS5uk7o","27589"

After a week at Double-A, the Angels elevated Neto straight to the big leagues and he's seized their everyday shortstop job, posting a 113 wRC+ as of list publication. There was some pre-draft consternation about Neto's swing, which is noisy and elaborate but very athletic, the way Neto (who's a smaller guy) gets the most out of his body. He has a cartoonish leg kick and his hands load similarly to Javier Báez's, and while Neto doesn't have quite the same all-world whip as Báez, he is a plus rotational athlete who hits some epic pull-side homers. The huge swing doesn't detract from Neto's feel for contact. He dials down his footwork with two strikes and becomes even tougher to put away. Also a plus athlete on defense, Neto does some acrobatic things at shortstop and shows plenty of arm for the left side when he puts his whole body into a throw. He was projected as a second baseman before the draft, but he's proven he can play shortstop.

He was quickly promoted to the big leagues this season and accumulated enough at-bats to exhaust rookie eligibility before the Royals list went live, a failure on my part. Garcia has the skill set of a plug-and-play everyday shortstop, but he's mostly played third base for the Royals because of Bobby Witt Jr.'s presence on the roster. He is an example of a traditionally under-ranked type of player who you could argue I (and my writing partners over the years) over-corrected on for a while, an up-the-middle defender without power, but plus contact and on-base skills. 
Garcia has lovely feel to hit and is especially adept at spraying contact to the opposite field, guiding the barrel all over the zone. His in-zone contact rates have been between 84-88% each year since he entered full-season ball in 2019, a magna cum laude tier of bat-to-ball performance. He tends to be late on fastballs, many of which he's capable of spraying the other way. Garcia's build gives him great long-term athletic projection and he may yet get stronger deep into his 20s, which might enable him to be more on time for the fastballs that he currently tends to foul off rather than barrel. Even with a great hit tool, Garcia' patience is arguably his best skill, but unless he develops more power, big league pitchers will attack him in the zone and suppress that skill's performance. 
Defensively, Garcia makes just about everything look absurdly easy at third base even though he doesn't have a ton of experience there. He has plus-plus hands and actions, a plus arm, and above-average range. I think he's a superior defensive player to Witt, but I also think you can argue that having Garcia rove the infield with his leather skeleton key helps elevate the way Nicky Lopez and Samad Taylor are deployed. He won't be a star unless he comes into meaningful power later than most hitters do, but Garcia is a foundational big leaguer who is going to play forever.",,"22715"

He went unselected in 2020 in part because he never had the opportunity to convince teams that he could start; he moved into the rotation as a fourth year junior in 2021. Abbott brought a third pitch to the party that year (a changeup, used twice as often as the year before) and ended up going in the second round. He was pushed through the minors aggressively and spent most of his first full pro season at Double-A Chattanooga, where he also began 2023 and showed a tweaked slider and a little more fastball velocity, at which point he moved into the Top 100.
Abbott's vertical fastball/breaking ball combo is the foundation of his profile. His low-90s heater has enough carry that it will often miss bats in the strike zone even when it isn't well-located. Release inconsistency has created confusion around whether Abbott has one or two different breaking balls. The shape and velocity of his breaker changes quite a bit. Manual pitch tagging in Synergy suggests he has a curve and slider, while automated pitch tagging (I went to multiple sources for this) suggests he has just one, mostly in the 76-82 mph range. During the most recent in-person look I've had at Abbott, he only warmed up with a curveball, not a curve and a slider. It's possible he's manipulating the shape of one breaking ball or that Abbott's inconsistent release is simply impacting what his breaker's movement looks like pitch to pitch. Ideally he'll have two distinct breakers at maturity since Abbott has such great feel for spin, but for now let's say he just has one. After his changeup usage spiked in his draft year, it was back down in the 8% range in 2022 and has been up again early in 2023. It's not an especially nasty pitch, but Abbott's feel for locating it is impressive considering he struggles with that in general. Components that would eventually allow Abbott to be a no. 4 starter on a contender are here and a dominant start to 2023 has accelerated his timeline to the big leagues.","iHroTkeeju4","29911"

A famous prospect since his days as a high school underclassman, Turang has never been a sure bet to do enough offensively to be an impact everyday player. As he has laid a statistical track record in pro ball, Turang's plate discipline became the tip of that spear, and even though his walk rate dipped to a mark merely above average (10%) in 2022, his rate of chase was a more superlative 23%, which would have been the best among qualified major league shortstops. Big league pitchers will be able to limit the damage Turang does by working him in the bottom half of the zone, where he struggles to lift the ball. While he can ambush high pitches, especially up-and-in, and show you close to average peak pop, Turang had not slugged over .400 in any pro season until he saw Triple-A in 2022. He projects to be similar to J.P. Crawford in skill and statistical output, a player good for 2 WAR annually. With Willy Adames ahead of him on the shortstop depth chart, the Brewers tried Turang at second, third and in center in 2022; he will likely be in a timeshare with Milwaukee's righty-hitting infield crew come 2023.","ndJStZbwH1c","22186"

As a fourth-year junior in 2021, he was still sitting 88-92 mph, with his fastball velocity sometimes drifting as low as 86 mph in a given start. He still threw a ton of strikes and went in the fifth round of the 2021 draft, projecting as a high-floor, low-ceiling depth starter based on his command. What a difference a year makes. By the middle of 2022, Bibee was sitting 95. He also altered his breaking ball usage (more sliders, fewer curves) and increased his changeup frequency, and was so advanced from a pitchability standpoint that Cleveland quickly saw fit to send him to Akron, where he spent most of his first pro season. Bibee seems to have altered his stride direction so that he isn't landing quite as closed as he was at Fullerton, which appears to enable him to stay behind the baseball a little better, creating riding action on a fastball that wasn't previously as explosive. He also appears to have reshaped his body somewhat, which may have contributed to the uptick in arm strength. The improved fastball utility and Bibee's slider command give him two major league-ready weapons, while his delivery's consistency and his long standing feel to pitch generate optimism around the continued growth of his changeup, which he's using more often now than when he was in college. It can be tough to turn over a changeup from his arm slot, but that slot is also part of how Bibee creates depth on his curveball, which has become a show-me pitch that he lands in the zone at will. He doesn't have to be put on the 40-man until after the 2024 season, but the rate at which he has been promoted so far indicates he'll be in the mix for a rotation spot sooner than that. Bibee now looks like a polished mid-rotation prospect.",,"30134"

Despite sitting 94-97 mph in outings that were often seen by decision-makers in to scout Asa Lacy and Christian Roa, Miller was passed over in the 2020 draft, largely because he was very wild. In 2021, he moved into the Aggies' rotation, and while his fastball would peak in the 95-98 range, he'd typically settle in at 92-94 as a starter and still had issues with walks. The Mariners drafted him in the fourth round and have deployed him as a starter while altering aspects of his delivery to keep Miller behind the baseball more consistently, which has added to the huge vertical ride on his fastball. His peak velocity also returned and stuck around, as his fastball averaged 96 mph throughout 2022, when Miller coasted through a season split between High- and Double-A. Assigned to Double-A Arkansas again at the start of 2023, it wasn't long before Miller kicked down the door to the big leagues, and while he's still a little rough around the edges, his fastball quality has been sufficient for him to beat big league hitters. 
Miller isn't a surgeon but that's fine, as his type of fastball has a ton of in-zone margin for error because of its shape and life. The same applies to his velocity. He's actually lost a tick off his fastball compared to 2022, and his velo has continued to trend down, but it's still blowing big leaguers away and is a legit plus-plus pitch. So long as he's in and around the zone, he doesn't need to have precise command to succeed. Miller will occasionally show you good secondary stuff, but most of his other pitches are below-average. He has a mid-80s cutter/slider that doesn't often have vertical depth, though it does have good length for how hard it is. His upper-70s curveball has more depth and plays nicely with his fastball, but it isn't a powerful, bat-missing breaker and Miller relies on the fastball to set it up. Miller's arm swing is long and he sometimes falls off the mound toward first base during his delivery, especially as he tires late in starts. He was somewhat walk-prone in 2022 and lots of scouts thought he ultimately projected in relief. Miller's fastball isn't quite as nasty as Spencer Strider's and his command isn't as good as Joe Ryan's, but those two represent examples of how, if your fastball is good enough, you can be a good big league starter by leaning on one monster pitch.  When you consider that Miller lost a lot of developmental time to the pandemic and being buried on A&M's depth chart, you can start to get excited about how much potential growth remains for him. He hit the injured list with a blister just before list publication.",,"29837"

He was suddenly a young-for-the-class college bat who might have gone very high in the draft if he'd hit like he had the year before and gotten better at second base. Unfortunately, he did neither. Julien's stock fell early during the 2019 college season as he struggled badly, then he got hot during a tumultuous postseason run; the Twins drafted him on Day Three. Julien tweeted he was going back to school, then went to the Cape and had a great two weeks, after which the Twins' offer rose to just shy of $500,000, inspiring him to sign. He had Tommy John in August of 2019 and rehabbed during a 2020 season that he would have missed anyway. 
Julien finally got underway in pro ball in 2021 and since then, he's had two good seasons en route to a 40-man roster spot, offseason placement on the Top 100 prospects list, and a 2023 big league debut. He's been as patient as any hitter in the minors and has walked at a 19% career rate; he has a .437 career OBP. When Julien does swing, he does so with bad intentions, taking a high-effort rip capable of putting balls out to all fields. He's going to reach base a ton and hit for power. It's enough that Julien comfortably projects as an everyday second baseman if it turns out he can stay there, and even though he has experience at other positions, second base is the only one he played in 2022. Julien has been without a true defensive home since college and didn't look great at the keystone during a prolonged look in the 2022 Arizona Fall League. He may just be a DH, which would obviously make it tougher for him to profile, but there may be elite on-base ability here and that, plus the power, will be enough for Julien to make an impact that way, too.","K56vCQi1Qeo","27534"

While he was already throwing quite hard, Ortiz came into even more velocity in 2022 and averaged 97 mph on his fastball, up two ticks from 2021. The pitch has natural tailing action, but Ortiz can also blow it past hitters at the letters when he wants, and his TrackMan data shows he's mixing in four- and two-seamers in the locations where they're most effective. His finishing pitch, though, is his slider, a nasty upper-80s sweeper that generated a 50% whiff rate and 38% chase rate in 2022. He commands it consistently enough to his glove side to project as a starter. In the past, Ortiz's high-effort delivery and sub-optimal fastball shape put him on the starter/reliever line, but he's thrown plenty of strikes across multiple seasons while simultaneously developing more velocity and comfortably projects as a starting pitcher now. How impactful a starter may depend on how his changeup, currently a tertiary offering, develops at the big league level. It shows above-average arm-side action on occasion, but he's only throwing it 12% of the time.

His deep repertoire already presented an obvious starter's foundation, but Libby's sinker plays down and the extra heat will make a meaningful difference against big league hitters. His lovely, trademark curveball has a 12-6 shape, and he’s deployed the pitch to particularly devastating effect against left-handed opponents — between Triple-A and the majors in 2022, only one lefty recorded a hit on the curveball — but it’s a less-than-ideal pairing with his fastball. His slider tunnels better with the four-seamer, but its whiff and chase rates have been more pedestrian, though now that he's throwing harder that might change. Meanwhile, his changeup hasn't yet made the necessary strides to consistently play against advanced righty hitters, but Liberatore's acumen for making adjustments and the grace and ease of his delivery allow for long-term projection in this area.

While Louie's delivery looks like it hurts, he's never had trouble throwing starter-quality strikes and has maintained his velo boost across multiple seasons, reaching Minnesota for 26 innings in 2022 and quickly establishing himself in the rotation in 2023. Mechanical look is a component in our starter/reliever projections, but Varland's consistency merits a sort of override, and his long-term projection has shifted from that of a single-inning reliever to a nasty four- or five-pitch starter. 
Most remarkable is Varland's slider feel in the wake of his mechanical violence. Everything finishes to his glove side, usually off the plate or below the zone where hitters can't do damage. There is a wide velo range and shape variability to Varland's cutters and sliders, which is maddening when you're trying to decipher how many different breakers he has but ultimately effective for keeping the baseball off of hitters' barrels. Every pitch plays like an average or better offering, and Varland throws them all for strikes at a high clip. He certainly has more long-term relief risk than an identically talented pitcher with a lovely, effortless delivery, but his stuff is comparable to lots of the relief-risk prospects on the Top 100 (guys like Drey Jameson and Wilmer Flores) and Varland has performed better from a strike-throwing standpoint than many of that cohort, so he slots in at the head of a cluster that includes those sorts of prospects.",,"27691"

Jameson had to take a turn in the rotation a few times earlier in the year, but lately he's been deployed as a multi-inning fireman. He's pitching about six innings per week in this role, so his workload is very similar to a starter's, just spread out over multiple days. 
Jameson sits 95-96 mph and touches 99, and he can add and subtract sink from his fastball. His mid-80s slider has been performing like a plus-plus pitch (24% swinging strike rate as of publication) so far. A slower curveball and occasional mid-80s changeup give Jameson the weapons to work through a lineup multiple times even though they're just fair. While his delivery features a lot of effort, Jameson has held velocity like this across a starter's workload every year since he was drafted. He lacks precise command, but he throws enough strikes to start and bully hitters with his velocity and slider for five and six innings at a time. Jameson is also a extremely competitive and has the makeup for a late-inning role should he have to make way for some of Arizona's other good young starters in perpetuity.","Npwp2kmfTQI","26260"

We had Waldichuk evaluated as a big-league ready, mid-rotation starter, but his command hasn't been very good and the A's move him into the bullpen near the end of May. Waldichuk’s arsenal also includes a changeup that he used to finish with remarkable precision, but like just about everything else, his feel for that pitch has regressed. He rounds out his four-pitch mix with a mid-70s curveball that he's thrown just 2.4% of the time in 2023. He’s shown the ability to induce significant swing-and-miss across all four offerings, both in and out of the zone, aided largely by his funky arm action. 
The area that will be the most important for Waldichuk to develop is his fastball command. He can land his breaking balls for strikes, but hitters sit on them after they have seen them once or twice and can ambush them when Waldi's trying to get ahead via his breakers. Commanding his fastball better than he has so far will help make him more unpredictable early in counts. Waldichuk’s delivery is freaky loose, particularly in his upper back and shoulders, a trait consistent with long-term big league starters. Even though he's 25, there's hope for progression in this area and, eventually, a more stable mid-rotation role, though our pre-season evaluation has been heavy to this point.","8FcvUE3nN4c","27681"

He also dealt with an eye condition that would later require surgery to strengthen the collagen fibers within his cornea, a procedure he had in 2020 while he also reworked his mechanics. Nelson had a dominant 2021 season spent mostly at Double-A Amarillo, striking out 163 hitters in 116.1 total innings, all as a starter. His strikeout numbers have backed up each of the last two seasons, including during his 2023 rookie season.
Nelson's velocity tends to fluctuate; as of list publication, it's been trending up over the last month or so, and he has averaged 95 mph. His changeup usage is also trending up, and he added a cutter this year. Similar to Pfaadt, it's important for Nelson to develop more precise feel for his fastball location, as too often, he mislocates lower in the zone where his fastball is vulnerable. If he can live in the tempting upper third of the strike zone and above, where his heater is almost impossible to hit due to its riding life, he'll miss more bats than he has to this point in the big leagues. Nelson used his fastball about 65% of the time in 2021 and 61% in 2022, both at the upper boundary of what is typical for a big league starter. That rate is down to 55% in 2023 as he mixes in his three different breaking balls and the changeup. Both his sequencing and location are unpredictable. Nelson will probably always work inefficiently, but he has too many weapons to put in the bullpen unless the D-backs think a move like that is the only way to get him missing bats again.",,"26253"

While his peak exit velocities have long been tops among his peers, college and pro, he didn't really start launching homers until after he was drafted, when it appears his swing and approach changed. Constant max-effort hacking often leads to lots of strikeouts, but Wiemer had mostly kept his Ks in check until 2022, when he punched out 30% of the time at Double-A Biloxi. His strikeout rate improved upon promotion to Triple-A, albeit in a smaller sample. Look under the hood and there is cause for concern. Wiemer often swings inside pitches on the outer third of the strike zone, and his in-zone swing and miss rates are on par with the bottom handful of big league outfielders who saw at least 300 PA in 2022, among names like Joey Gallo and Christopher Morel. While not quite as mountainous as skill set-cousins Gallo or Jorge Soler, Wiemer's size and physicality set him apart from other players, even big leaguers, and he seems likely to get to power in big league games by virtue of how much raw thump he has.

After it looked like he had filled out to a point that was impacting his agility and throwing in a way that limited him to first base, Vientos now looks like an above-average defender at third. His range and the quickness of his actions are both much better now than a year ago, though his arm accuracy is still a little bit mixed. He does some things better than Brett Baty and you can make a coherent argument that Vientos is currently the better defender of the two, though the Mets starting Baty at third and Vientos at DH when they're both in the lineup indicates they think otherwise. That's also true of Vientos relative to Pete Alonso at first base. Vientos began to see some time at first base (and in left field, though that's since been scrapped) in 2021; more recently, his split between third and first has been pretty even. His lack of experience at the position sometimes rears its head via Vientos' on-field decision making, but he's a much better hands and feet athlete over there than Alonso is. His presence on the big league roster means Buck Showalter can play left/right matchups with Vientos and either Baty or Daniel Vogelbach, and give Alonso the occasional day off or start at DH to lighten the load on his legs. 
Vientos could hit his way into an everyday role over time. He certainly has the power to profile at either corner infield spot, but his bat-to-ball skills have long been suspect. Vientos' early 2023 strikeout rate is closer to average, but that could simply be due to natural adjustments he's made in his second year at Syracuse. His swing has changed in a few subtle ways, though. His stance is more upright, his leg kick is bigger, and his bat is a little less wrapped toward the pitcher when his hands load. While these changes don't seem sufficient to explain him cutting his strikeout rate by about a third, they do seem to have improved things in this area and have also altered Vientos' ball-in-play spray. He's much better able to pull fastballs on the inner third now than he was in 2022, when he was inside-outing a lot of center cut fastballs to right field. There is still a lot of in-zone swing and miss here, but Vientos' ability to time and damage fastballs that he previously struggled with looks better and his conditioning (and by extension his defense) has definitely improved. The Mets' depth and roster situation will likely limit his role in the short-term, but Vientos' recent improvements have him back in the 50 FV tier projecting as an everyday third baseman in a vacuum.","ax1yE3rIWCs","22184"

It comes out of his hand from a high arm slot that looks like the kind optimized for data-friendly ride, but the pitch's downhill angle makes it less of a weapon at the letters and actually makes it very vulnerable within the strike zone. Perhaps as an adjustment to deal with this issue, Priester now mixes in plenty of fastballs for which he pronates on release, giving the pitch screwball-like spin. Its bat-missing capabilities are limited to the bottom arm-side portion of the zone, where this two-seam-ish fastball tends to finish. Many scouts are champing at the bit over Priester's prototypical frame and four- or five-pitch mix, depending on whether you consider his fastballs two distinct pitches. Quants and front office analyst types are more bearish, citing issues with Priester's fastball playability. His fastball velocity is down, in the 92-94 mph range, a far cry from Priester's upper-90s peak. In 2022, it garnered just 8% whiffs and 13% chase during his time at Double-A, where he spent most of the season. However, Priester makes up for it with his preferred secondaries — a huge, arcing curveball that Priester has had forever, and a more recently developed mid-80s slider — both of which have garnered swing-and-miss rates well above the big league average. Neither his slider nor changeup is fully baked quite yet, but if either (or both) become viable, they would bring with them a higher probability that Priester slots in as a mid-rotation starter.

Not a single one of Wesneski’s offerings is generating an above-average swinging strike rate, compared to three of them doing so during his 2022 cup of coffee. He throws the sweeper (as it's now called) about a third of the time, with the rest of his mix split between his three fastballs. His inability to miss bats consistently, along with one of the highest HR/9 in baseball, resulted in a move to the bullpen, where his slider usage has seen a more exaggerated uptick.

I was light on this guy by a lot — he's playing like a 60. The tool grades are mostly correct, except for my assessment of Yoshida's game power. He has an 8 bat and is slugging .467 as of publication. I didn't so much underestimate how much contact Yoshida would make, as I underestimated the quality of that contact. He's an unbelievably skilled hitter who quickly adjusted to the quality of big league stuff after a little bit of a slow start. You just don't know whether a hitter is going to be able to hit major league velocity until they do it, and in Yoshida's case he is really doing it, slashing .366/.438/.610 against fastballs 95 mph and above as of June 6. I maintain that you can get this guy out by executing soft stuff down-and-away from him, and I will note that as well as Yoshida is playing, he is actually tracking beneath what the models projected for him before the season. 
Here's my offseason report with some fat trimmed out. The entire original report is still saved on the International Players section of The Board: While Yoshida's skill set is shaped in an extreme hit-over-power style atypical of a big league corner outfielder, there are others who have had success with similarly tailored talent, most especially Steven Kwan and Jeff McNeil, with the likes of Tony Kemp and Jurickson Profar providing a look at the bottom of what an acceptable range of performance outcomes for Yoshida would be. This guy can hit. Yoshida is a career .327/.421/.539 hitter in NPB with more walks than strikeouts; the last two seasons, he's actually walked twice as often as he's struck out. Even though he's not very physical and is a left field-only guy, he's arguably elite at the game's most important skill. His ability to maneuver the barrel around the zone by altering not only his hands but also the overall posture of his body is very special, and there isn't a spot in the strike zone where he can't make contact with the baseball. 
But while Yoshida is such an explosive rotator for his size that his bat often strikes the ground behind him at the end of his follow through, he hits the ball on the ground a lot, with a GB% in the 47–51% range for the last six seasons. Opposing pitchers can limit his ability to do damage by working him with soft stuff down and away, though Yoshida is still going to find a way to put the ball in play. His measly 5% swinging-strike rate was seventh-best among qualified NPB hitters in 2022, and only one of the hitters ahead of him could muster more than three homers; Yoshida yanked out 21. Among the best contact hitters in NPB, he separated himself with how much power he got to (note from Future Eric: in retrospect, this was a key detail). The hit tool is going to translate, and his plate discipline probably will, too; his 23% O-Swing% would put him among the majors' 10 most selective outfielders. The contact/OBP combo should enable him to produce in the 1.5–2 WAR range, similar to the last couple seasons of Andrew Benintendi or a more patient Alex Verdugo. It's possible that the amount and quality of contact Yoshida makes gives him a higher power ceiling than I anticipate.","Y1EvJHg9mxc","31837"

He is the player on the Phillies list who is the most likely to occupy a spot on SportsCenter's Top 10 during the next five summers because of his ability to haul ass into each gap and make incredible diving plays, and Rojas' center field defense alone is going to enable him to play a considerable big league role. Heck, the Phillies just traded an everyday catcher for Brandon Marsh largely because Marsh is a good center field defender, and there just aren't many of those around at any given time, let alone a special one like Rojas. 
In a 2022 season split between High-A Lakewood and Double-A Reading (a hitter's haven), Rojas slashed a very vanilla .244/.309/.354, albeit with 34 extra-base hits and an incredible 62 steals in 67 attempts. Readers have seen versions of this swing before, as Rojas' set-up is almost identical to Ronald Acuña Jr.'s, he just doesn't have the same feel for loft that Acuña does. Instead, Rojas (who swings really hard) has a flat cut through the upper two thirds of the zone and a downward bat path when he's trying to impact pitches at the bottom. While his athleticism allows him to get deep into his lower half to dip and try to rip those low pitches, he just can't do anything meaningful with them. Rojas' contact rates are not only fine, they're exceptional — he had an 88% Z-contact% in 2022, which is comfortably better than the average big league starting center fielder — it's just that pitchers who can execute location can really limit the damage Rojas does. Because he's such an incredible athlete, it's possible that at some point during his big league career Rojas will make an adjustment that enables him to damage pitches down there more readily. The tools for stardom are here, but for now Rojas is a glove-first center fielder whose skill set typically fits at the very bottom of a good lineup.","rCSL8llLNAw","24336"

He was a 2021 pre-draft favorite here at the site because of his ultra-athletic delivery and his fastball's underlying characteristics, which, with his mid-90s velocity, were nearly certain to give him at least one impact pitch. A Tommy John prevented him from debuting until late in 2022, when he made 16 starts during the regular season and finished in the Fall League. In 2023, his quick promotion to Seattle has forced Woo to lean on his fastball(s) at an unsustainable rate because the rest of his repertoire is still developing. Between his four- and two-seamers combined, Woo is using his heater 75% of the time as of list publication. There isn't a qualified starter anywhere near that mark. 
The good news is that there's reason to project on his secondary stuff. Woo's athleticism and arm action portend significant changeup growth over time, and it wouldn't surprise me if that's eventually his best secondary pitch; his cambio usage was climbing in the couple of starts leading up to list publication. He has a mid-80s spike slider that is currently operating as his most-used non-fastball offering, and the quality and location of that pitch varies wildly. There's evidence that Woo has begun using a cutter in games, beginning with his late-June start against the Nationals. Several of his breaking balls were harder than his usual sliders and it didn't look like he was using the spike grip he uses for his slider to throw them. You can see things are still rather magmatic here. Woo is developing on the fly and it's remarkable that he's had success at the big league level despite this. I'd love to 50 him and put another Pick to Click feather in my cap, but I feel like I'd be putting my thump on the scale. There's still too much hay to be made with his secondary stuff to do that at this time, though he's clearly a good pitching prospect and I think over time he'll look more like a slam dunk mid-rotation starter.",,"30279"

But the strength of his upper body enables Gelof to use that atypical swing to generate power, with above-average exit velocities and power-friendly launch angles. Coming into last season, his home runs were hit almost exclusively to his pull side, but in 2022, 13 of his 18 dingers were sent over the opposite field fence, including all five of the ones he hit in his nine games at Triple-A. His extra-base hits have been sprayed all over the field so far in 2023. Gelof's improved ability to apply his power to all fields is a step forward in an already-impressive offensive profile. He’s currently on pace for more homers than last season, and his walk rate is one of the highest in the PCL. Even though he's striking out more than is ideal, Gelof has performed above the league average throughout his entire minor league career, often by a wide margin. He’s spent time at both second and third base in the past, but thus far only played second base in 2023, which hints at what the A’s have in mind for his future development. There's enough pop and on-base skill here to give Gelof a shot to be an average everyday second baseman, though his strikeout rates keep him just outside the top 100 at this stage.","dfzuDogVxpg","29766"

Some aspects of that optimistic projection still exist, while others have changed or are currently absent, but the tools package here is still on par with the middle of the everyday second baseman player population, and we're hoping that young Peguero will polish up his game's current smudges. For instance, he's struggled badly on defense, wracking up 46 errors combined the last two seasons. Peguero's lack of throwing accuracy from shortstop is concerning. He appears tentative on routine throws and still isn't a sure-handed defender. His range, footwork, ability to bend, and overall athleticism are all plus, and it made sense to try to develop him as a shortstop for as long as possible, but Peguero finally saw time at second base in 2022 and a permanent move there will hopefully help him throw more confidently and accurately. If his defense continues to look like it did in the 2022-23 Dominican Winter League during 2023 spring training, he may quickly be repositioned on this list. 
A second base-only defensive fit puts the onus on Peguero's bat to perform at an everyday level. After coasting through the low and mid-minors, he finally hit a speed bump in 2022, posting his first below-average statline as a 21-year-old at Double-A Altoona. Aspects of the offensive profile that made him exciting in the first place are still here, led by Peguero's compact but authoritative swing, which is especially good at punishing pitches at the very top of the strike zone. (One weird scouting note: Peguero chokes up with two strikes, but only with his top hand, creating separation between his two hands à la Kevin Youkilis.) His overall pitch recognition, especially against breaking balls, has become a more noticeable issue. Peguero's pull-heavy style of contact leaves him vulnerable to breaking balls on the outer half, even ones that catch a lot of the plate. His quality of contact is very good when he does make it, and is already on par with the typical starting major league second baseman even though he's barely 22. His 2022 performance deserves some age-related adjustment, but it's possible we saw flaws in Peguero's game exposed by upper-level pitching. He has the talent to be an everyday player, but has to improve in one or two key areas (throwing accuracy, slider recognition) for that to be his outcome.","kBYfk4hzOdY","24273"

He missed time in 2022 due to injury and when he returned in late August, he showed a more mature approach, reducing what had historically been an inflated strikeout rate. He continued that during a very promising showing in the AFL, where he struck out at just a 20% clip and matched that rate in walks. Then, in his 12 spring training games, he struck out just four times and walked just as often while going 11-for-23 with four doubles, a triple, and a homer, good for a .478/.556/.870 slash line. It’s hard to say just how many small samples it takes to constitute sustained confidence in these improvements at the plate, but he’s continued to limit his swing and miss issues in thus far 2023, with a strikeout rate below 20% at Double-A. Assuming Butler stays healthy for all of 2023, his flirtation with a better approach shows promising signs of blossoming into a full-blown romance, which will be a major difference-maker regarding his big league viability.

He became Oakland's Opening Day starter, which speaks volumes about the state of both orgs. The A’s acquired Muller just four outs away from him graduating from prospect eligibility, which he has since done despite being sent down in late May. A towering southpaw, he had brief big league stints in both 2021 and 2022, spending the majority of both seasons at Triple-A. 
In 2022, his strike throwing ability was markedly improved across all four pitches in his arsenal. In his time at Triple-A in 2021, he only threw his fastball for strikes about 63% of the time. In contrast, 71% of the heaters he threw at Triple-A in 2022 were strikes, an obvious improvement that helped set up his secondary stuff for chase later in counts. Both his slider (thrown 30% of the time) and a two-plane, mid-80s curveball (13% usage) garner whiff- and chase-rates well above the big league average. He seemed able to carry his improved strike-throwing ability into 2023, but Muller's fastball has lost two ticks compared to last year, which as you'll read, is a common trend among pitchers in this org.

CES has made himself into a viable third base defender, though he's still a little stiff over there and the Reds began to accelerate how often he was deployed at first base after they acquired him. There are definitely times when he looks too stiff to play third and others when he finds clever ways to use effort and physicality to send the baseball where it needs to be in time, and his max-effort arm strength is plenty for third. Corner defense profiles with this amount of chase are scary and at risk of busting or becoming a Matt Davidson type of Quad-A hitter.

He looked the part in the early days of his development, emerging rapidly after his signing in 2016. He's always performed at or above a league average level with the bat and is an especially gifted contact hitter for a catcher, but Herrera's defense has plateaued and remains below average across the board. The offseason signing of Willson Contreras was an indication not only that was Herrera no longer seen as surefire successor to Yadier Molina, but also that the Cardinals thought Contreras, who isn't a good defender, was fine enough to be a primary backstop while Herrera was not. When Contreras struggled early in 2023, the team did not turn to Herrera as a bandaid, even as he was hitting down in Memphis, and the Cardinals are carrying one more catcher on their 40-man roster (four) than is typical. 
A scouting rule of thumb is to give catchers who have any kind of offensive ability as much developmental runway as possible. The industry inventory behind the plate isn't exactly flush with good hitters, and lots of bat-first catchers take until they're deep into their 20s to polish their gloves enough to truly ascend to a primary role. Herrera's 2022 in-zone contact rates were incredible (89%) and he's historically been an above-average contact hitter with plus feel for the strike zone. An inside out swing means most of Herrera's fly ball contact goes to the opposite field, where he does mostly doubles damage. It's too much offense to consider Herrera merely a backup catcher prospect, but not enough for him to profile at another position if he doesn't improve back there. He's running out of option years and has to be traded or elevated to a big league role within the next year. He might initially be a part-time or backup catcher, but projects to have some seasons as an above-average offensive performer at the position later during his pre-free agency years.","Dj8kYAesv6M","20599"

Then Shuster came out showing a little velo spike during 2023 spring training, though it's tough to be confident that it will stick given his history. While Shuster has below-average fastball velocity, his heater has other characteristics that help enable it to punch above its weight, though it isn't a plus pitch at its current velocity. He continues to rely on his plus changeup, of which he has plus command. Shuster locates his cambio down and to his arm side with remarkable consistency. It is by far his best offering and has enough action that hitters tend to swing inside of it even when it's finishing in the strike zone. Shuster’s slider is not so great and relies on living in that enticing, off-the-plate location where most sliders play best. Shuster's ability to get it there is not as consistent as it is with his other offerings, but the way he hides the ball gives him some margin for error in that regard, especially against opposing lefties.

Jones played shortstop in high school but, realistically at his size, he was at best going to be a third baseman in pro ball. His size has made that difficult, and Cleveland (partially because of their big league needs) gave up on it in 2022, when Jones only played right field and DH'd. Traded to the Rockies for second baseman Juan Brito, Jones is back to sometimes playing on the dirt and has seen action at all four corner positions. The dominoes that fell as a result of the Brendan Rodgers injury opened up reps at third base, where the rust from his lack of 2022 time showed upon reintroduction, and he actually looks most comfortable at first. But it's not as if Jones immediately took to the outfield in 2022, and if he's going to be a 40 defender, it may as well be at his most valuable possible position. While he's played all four corner spots in the minors, he's mostly played right field and first base during his 2023 big league time.
Jones has long produced above-average walk rates, but there's disagreement in the industry as to whether he's passive or actually selective. His walk rates have come way down as he's climbed the ladder, which is perhaps evidence of the former. While he has plus raw power, Jones' looping swing (which is vulnerable to fastballs up and away from him) tends to generate low-lying contact that causes his in-game pop to play down, and he tends to only damage mistakes that find their way to the inner third of the plate. His gigantic frame still isn't totally filled out, and he probably has room to add another full grade of raw power as he matures. Even with a 40-grade hit tool, if Jones ever finds a way to get to more of that power in games, he might just be an everyday 1B/DH. Here he's projected as a four corner platoon option.","S1tP3qEVSW8","20529"

In a season split between Double-A Chattanooga and Triple-A Louisville, Williamson's strikeout rates dipped to career lows while his walk rates leapt to career highs upon each subsequent promotion. He made 27 healthy starts and held his 90-94 mph velocity all season, which is a stroke in the ""pro"" column for Williamson's 2022 after he had shown velocity fluctuations in the past. But after a fantastic May, the length and efficiency of those starts took a nosedive, and he walked 36 hitters across his final 45 innings (11 starts) of the slate before he was added to the 40-man roster following the season. Scouts and executives who saw Williamson still thought he pitched pretty well in their looks. 
Williamson is always likely to be inefficient from a strike-throwing standpoint because of how he pitches off his fastball, aiming at the top of the strike zone and above, where his heater is less likely to be hit but also less likely to be a strike. Off of that fastball he works a mid-80s slider, a mid-70s curveball, and a low-80s changeup, and his ability to mix these offerings in an unpredictable fashion still excites scouts and gives Williamson a good shot to pitch toward the back of a contender's rotation. Aside from the slider, none of his other secondaries played like an above-average offering in 2022. His curveball has visually-pleasing depth but is perhaps a little too slow to fool upper-level hitters, while the changeup's sink action looks great on paper but doesn't play as well in games. Williamson's slider does, however, and it can act as a chase pitch like most sliders do and also parachute into the top of the strike zone from above, as hitters don't seem to be able to tell it apart from his fastball when he locates it up there. Nearly 25 now, it's getting a little late for the command component of Williamson's skill set to develop, and he isn't the sort of electric on-mound athlete for whom you want to project late growth in this area. He has a starter's mix and some of his stuff plays up due to underlying pitch characteristics, enough to consider him a five-and-dive no. 4/5 starter likely to debut in 2023 and seize a rotation spot within a year.","yBKAHA0BZyY","25463"

So wild was Uribe in 2021 that the Brewers left him off their roster and exposed him to a Rule 5 Draft that never happened. A torn left meniscus limited him to all but a few innings during the 2022 regular season, but Uribe's stuff was intact when he returned in the fall, and for two months, he had the most consistent strike-throwing stretch of his pro career. At instructs and in the AFL he sat 98-101 mph with an upper-80s power slider, which has ridiculous, curveball-like depth at 87-89 mph. He will peak in the 103-104 range on occasion. His delivery isn't especially violent for someone who routinely sits in the mid-90s and above, which creates optimism that the strike-throwing progression is for real. Uribe is cut from late-inning cloth, brings a Papelbonesque edge to the mound and has big, bombastic energy in the dugout. There's definitely risk of regression here, and perhaps Uribe will have stretches (he had a few terrible late-November appearances in LIDOM) where he's fighting himself like a right-handed José Alvarado.

He has more or less coasted through the minors, slashing .274/.371/.489 as a pro, albeit with higher strikeout rates (often in the 24-27% range, depending on the level) than one would have anticipated when Westburg was an amateur prospect. He spent most of 2022 at Triple-A Norfolk, where he hit 18 of his 27 home runs in just 91 games. Westburg tends to swing over the top of breaking balls executed in the bottom third of the strike zone and below, often pulling off of those too early, and he's vulnerable enough within the strike zone to project his hit tool below the big league average. This is a pull-centric, power-over-hit skill set despite the career batting average. 
Even though he's on the doorstep of the big leagues, Westburg doesn't have a clear position yet. He's played all over the infield but his arm is best suited to play second base, maybe even left field eventually. Seemingly similar to other upper-level hitters with bat-first (some would argue bat-only) profiles, Westburg's handedness slides him behind guys like Jonathan Aranda, Edouard Julien and Michael Busch, while other righty bats like Miguel Vargas and Spencer Steer have superior bat-to-ball skills. There has to be some separation between Westburg and that group of 50s to account for his combination of strikeouts and below-average defense.

He slashed .282/.343/.483 in 187 games spread across multiple seasons in Japan. After the 2019 NPB season, Colas essentially defected from Cuba by not returning after his season in Asia. He then began a long standoff with the Hawks regarding his contract's validity, arguing that he and his mother (he was a minor when he was initially transferred to Fukuoka) had insufficient time to review Spanish-language contract documents after he arrived in Japan. Colas won his grievance and was released from his deal, setting things up for him to establish residency outside of Cuba and sign with an MLB club in 2021, subject to the bonus restrictions of international amateur players. He got $2.7 million from the Sox and came to his first camp in fantastic shape, which wasn't always true while he was in Japan. 
And Colas had a slug-heavy first season in affiliated ball, slashing .314/.371/.524 at mostly High- and Double-A, clubbing 24 homers and 51 extra-base hits on his way to a cup of coffee with Charlotte at the end of the year. There are aspects of that surface-level performance that appear legitimate and sustainable, and other indications that there will be a regression here. Colas certainly has power, majestic low-ball, pull-side pop resulting in some emphatic homers. Both visual and measurable evaluations of his power put it in the present 55/60 area, but there are justifiable questions about whether he'll hit enough to get to it despite his surface-level performance. In this case, it's less about barrel control issues (aside from his inability to lift pitches on the outer third, Colas has fair in-zone feel for contact) and more about chase, an aspect of Colas' game that was tough to know about entering the year. He only walked at a 7% clip in Japan and had a very expansive approach throughout 2022, slugging and BABIP'ing his way through it. The issue is drastic enough to keep Colas' projection that of a corner platoon rather than an everyday right fielder. Perhaps there'd be enough power to support an everyday profile if Colas could play center field, but even though he spent a ton of time there while in A-ball, he trended more toward right field after promotion to Birmingham and Colas simply doesn't have the sleek look or top-end speed of a viable center fielder. The pace at which Colas has been promoted suggests a mid-to-late 2023 debut is in the cards if he can keep hitting at Triple-A, though the addition of Andrew Benintendi clouds that timeline.","jNhb8xqXBiQ","30162"

But as Triolo's pro success with the bat continued at a high level, and with Ke’Bryan Hayes manning the hot corner for the Pirates’ foreseeable future, the Pirates began searching for defensive alternatives in order to plug Triolo into their lineup. They're finding them. During a full season at Double-A in 2022, he saw time at third base, shortstop, and center field, and in 2023 he'll start seeing more time at second base. Triolo earned industry praise for his defensive aptitude and high marks for his baseball IQ and instincts. His acrobatics and creativity at third base make him a plus defender there. He clearly wasn't comfortable in center field during his brief time there last season, but he only played there once every couple of weeks and he isn't a firm ""no"" at the position, even if he is bad there right now. Given how good he is at third, it seems likely that Triolo will be a good defensive second baseman if given enough time, and he's a fine emergency option at short (Kyle Farmer has played there a ton and Triolo is about that good).
What's more, there's a chance Triolo hits enough to simply be an everyday option at second (or if he turns out to be okay in center). He spent much of the season leading off for Altoona, where he slashed .282/.376/.419 and stole 24 stolen bases. His swing decisions and ability to make contact out front and tap into his latent power improved throughout the season. If you split his season exactly in half, the improvement is obvious. While his walk and strikeout rates were both descent through the first half of 2022, only nine of his 57 hits through mid-June went for extra bases (eight doubles and a home run). From that point on, however, Triolo walked more and struck out less, such that both rates sat in the mid-teens, while flipping the slugging switch on to the tune of 13 doubles, five triples, and eight home runs over the course of the same number of games. This impressive performance inspired his offseason 40-man addition. Triolo's swing and footwork in the box make him vulnerable in a couple of obvious ways (high heat, sliders away), and we don't think the 60-grade hit, 45-grade power profile that he has put on paper so far will hold quite that much water against big league arms. If it does, he should be a 50, and that grade was discussed during the Pirates list-making process. If a clearer path at third base existed in this org, that might have been enough for us to do it.

His upper-80s fastball plays up because of its rise and the nearly seven and a half feet of extension Bradford generates down the mound. He has dictatorial control over his entire repertoire, working his fastball up and to his glove side and then pitching off that with a mid-80s cutter/slider.

His 2022 season, during which he hit .296/.376/.542 and tallied 65 extra-base hits against upper-level pitching, solidified him as the latter, and he was part of the two-player package that came back from Houston for Christian Vázquez.
Valdez packs quite a wallop for a 5-foot-9 hitter. He swings really hard and is capable of hitting for power to all fields, turning on pitches that find the inner third of the plate and bending to spray hard contact the other way against stuff finishing away from him. His hands are a little noisy as they load, and he has a bit of a hitch before they fire, but his levers are so short that he tends to be on time anyway. His stance and aggressive, uphill swing are like a cover band's rendition of Juan Soto's cut. Vulnerable to fastballs running up and away from him (even ones that finish in the zone), Valdez's hit tool will likely settle in south of average, but he's going to get to considerable power thanks to his bat speed and damage-seeking style of swinging. 
He has experience in both outfield corners and at every infield position but shortstop, seeing time most frequently second base, where he has played almost exclusively during his 2023 big league debut. Like a dull Swiss Army knife, he isn't especially good at any of them. He'll make some sweet plays out of sheer effort but struggles at other times due to below-average range, hands, and actions, frequently costing the team an out on double play attempts due to a slow pivot (his feeds to the bag tend to be good, though). The death of the shift will further stretch him on defense, and he might end up playing more 1B/LF than anywhere else over time, but there's enough platoon-friendly offense happening here to consider Valdez a core part-time player.",,"21716"

He began the 2022 slate on a delay and rehabbed in extended spring training until the very end of April. Quickly thereafter he was at Triple-A Norfolk and looked like the usual DL Hall, wielding three plus pitches and struggling with walks. In mid-August, the Orioles moved Hall to the bullpen, and after just four relief appearances over a span of 12 days, he was promoted to Baltimore for a 13-inning cup of coffee. Hall didn't throw harder in a relief role — he was still parked in the 95-97 mph range — and in fact his velo keeled off a little bit right at the very end of the season. His plus velocity and uphill approach angle make Hall's fastball extremely difficult for hitters to get on top of, and righty batters who are trying to anticipate the heater often end up embarrassing themselves against his changeup, which generated a whopping 54% whiff rate in 2022. His slider (Hall was almost exclusively a fastball/slider pitcher against lefties during his big league run) is firm and now has better movement demarcation from his curveball, which is easily his least-used offering, usually a backdoor option to righties. It's possible that aspects of his repertoire will be pared down in relief. Even as a pure reliever at this point, Hall still belongs on a Top 100 list due to his proximity and the likelihood that he becomes a lights out lefty closer or multi-inning buzzsaw who provides some amount of karmic retribution for the Josh Hader trade.","uN2TRUVwjs4","22207"

He quickly became the most promising of the young infielders the club signed that year and was pushed to full season ball late during his age-17 season, well out ahead of the others in his class. After a rough statistical 2018 as a very young player at Low-A Fort Wayne, Arias had great seasons on paper in '19 and '21, the latter coming after Cleveland had acquired him from San Diego as part of the Mike Clevinger trade and skipped him over Double-A. He hit .284/.348/.454 as a 21-year-old with Columbus before regressing in 2022, when he essentially repeated the level. Injuries and ineffectiveness at first base on the Guardians' big league roster pressed Arias into action at an unfamiliar position during their playoff series with the Yankees. He then picked up about a month's worth of games in Puerto Rico during the winter. 
Arias' approach and hit tool scare scouts and analysts, but he's grown into considerable power as his body has matured, and this has occurred without detracting from his fantastic infield defense. He is extremely strong for a legit defensive shortstop — you can see Arias' lats through his jersey for goodness sake — and while he doesn't have especially precise feel for contact, he tends to smoke the balls he does put in play. His 43% hard-hit rate in 2022 would have been in the top five among qualified big league shortstops, it's just that Arias' hardest contact tends to be on the ground. Chase and whiff prone in the zone, this looks like a player who'll wind up with a 30-grade hit tool and run career OBPs in the .290-.310 range. Willy Adames is a wildly successful version of this kind of skill set, but his rate contact stats and the lift in his swing are both superior to Arias', so that's definitely not a comp. Instead, Arias' glove is likely to be what dictates his role as a utility infielder with an atypical skill set for this org. His power gives him a chance to have some peak years with 20-plus homers, maybe more if Arias can find a swing that better taps into his raw thump.","bzG6c8ZDi_g","22563"

After a few years toiling away in San Diego's org while struggling with chase, Ruiz posted a 2022 stat line that will give you a strong urge to check for typos. He slashed .332/.447/.526 and, absurd as it may seem, Ruiz stole 85 bases last year. He started the season at the Padres’ Double-A affiliate, where he swiped 37 bags in 49 games, then moved up to Triple-A and increased that clip to 23 bags in 28 games. He was then dealt to the Brewers as part of the Josh Hader trade and added another 25 steals in his 37 games with Triple-A Nashville. He was traded yet again during the offseason as part of the Sean Murphy three-team swap and has slotted in as Oakland's regular center fielder in 2023. 
Having played second base up until 2019, Ruiz moved to the outfield when play resumed in 2021 after the lost pandemic season and has stayed there ever since, primarily in center with a smattering of innings in either corner. His speed is a natural fit in the outfield, and those wheels help make up for slightly below-average instincts and a second baseman’s arm. The progress he's made as a defender in center field is the most important component of his profile. So far this year, Ruiz has shown an affinity for situational hitting, posting an eye-popping slashline with runners in scoring position despite a rather anemic one overall. But as predicted, he’s proven to be a speed-first player, leading the majors in stolen bases over the first several months of the season. Due to his grooved, pull-heavy swing, we're still inclined to think he's more likely to be a nine-hole hitting speedster with a solid glove and very little bat, basically a fourth outfielder on a contender.","PgBHF2I2c08","21780"

While some scouts thought he had pro potential as a hurler, an arm injury kept him off the mound during his junior year and Wallner's huge raw power carried most of the water for his draft profile. He had some of the most explosive raw thump in the 2019 draft class, drawing 70 or 80 grades from scouts. 
The 2021 season was Wallner's first full pro campaign, and he hit 15 homers in just 66 games (slashing .264/.350/.508) as an old-for-the-level 23-year-old at High-A. His season was interrupted by a broken hamate, which can sometimes sap power output for many months after surgery to remove the broken bone, but Wallner slugged .465 in the 50-ish games he played after returning from surgery and kept on hitting for power against Fall League pitching. He then proceeded to lead all the minor leagues in hard-hit rate in 2022. By a lot. Wallner had a 60% hard-hit rate last year, nearly eight percentage points better than Rays prospect Curtis Mead, who was second. Wallner was at or near the top of every measurable power category in the minors last year and slashed .277/.412/.542 with 27 homers in a season split between Double- and Triple-A. He tallied 63 extra-base hits in just 128 games and made his big league debut in September.
Why isn't this guy just a top 100 prospect? Well, Wallner is a liability on defense and his hit tool is pretty flimsy. While he has thunderous, impact power, there are fair questions about whether or not he'll get to it against big league stuff because of how often he swings and misses. He is often underneath high fastballs and over the top of offspeed stuff, even when both are finishing in the zone. His 70% Z-contact% last year would have comfortably ranked last among qualified big league hitters (Josh Donaldson's 75.5% mark was dead last in 2022). A below-average athlete with poor body control, Wallner is a bumbling outfielder and baserunner. It's possible he'll experience late growth in these areas because, after all, we're talking about a former two-way player who has missed significant time due to the pandemic and injury, but these will likely be long-term flaws in Wallner's game. Still, there is so much playable power here that Wallner is likely to be a strong-side platoon option as a RF/DH who has some years with 25-30 bombs.",,"26466"

He’s still the contact-first, chop-and-spray hitter he’s always been, an approach to hitting enabled and bolstered by his speed, which allows him to beat out infield singles. The type of contact he makes is unlikely to ever lead to home run power commensurate with a true everyday player, but Bae makes enough stinging, all-fields contact that he projects to hit plenty of doubles and triples. His defensive versatility will allow the Pirates to play in-game matchups that take advantage of Bae's speed and ability to put balls in play. He spent more of his big league time in the outfield than at his native second base. He doesn't always look comfortable out there, but his speed makes him viable at all three spots, solidifying his role as a heavily-used role player even without the power production.",,"23818"

He's especially adept at dropping the bat head to yoink liners into the right field corner, and his barrel stays in the hitting zone long enough to spray some outer edge fastballs to left. Big league pitchers exposed a vulnerability to high-and-away fastballs, and Brennan may have to make an adjustment to keep hitting at the rate he did in the minors. Outside of the doubles, he's probably not going to hit for significant power, so it's important that he find a way to make those adjustments to preserve his excellent bat-to-ball production.

He's still a damn good pitcher who projects either as an inefficient five-inning starter or an excellent reliever capable of giving you four-to-six outs at a time. The angle and shape of Pepiot's fastball gives it bat-missing ability at the top of the zone even though it has average velocity, and his high-spin changeup is a plus offering that plays down because Pepiot's feel for locating it comes and goes. There are times when he can be effectively wild with the cambio, accidentally running it back over the glove-side corner of the plate in unhittable fashion, and then there are times when the pitch isn't enticing at all. Surprisingly, Pepiot's cutter generated the highest swinging strike rate of his three offerings in his 36 big league innings and, after he arrived in pro ball with a lousy curveball, he's developed a good enough breaking ball to have a starter's mix, it's just that the command component remains behind.","rolBnvOrIE0","26221"

He takes such wild full-body hacks that sometimes he looks like he's going to faceplant in the batter's box, but Basabe finds all sorts of funky ways to put the bat on the baseball, usually in the form of high infield choppers and opposite-field line drives. We're talking about a 91% Z-contact rate in 2022, a 70 on the scale. Almost completely lacking over-the-fence power (he has just eight career homers in four seasons), Basabe is like a boxer who beats you with nothing but jabs. He's passable at shortstop but a better fit at third and second base, where he makes acrobatic plays through sheer effort, and his lightning-quick transfer makes him especially good at fielding high choppers that he has to get rid of quickly, which third base sees most often.

He started the season at High-A, posting walk and strikeout rates better than the league average while slashing .273/.363/.474 with 17 homers in 93 games. He then played 29 games at Double-A, where he improved every column of his slash line while maintaining a strikeout rate close to the 22% mark he'd put up in Eugene. It was at this point, though, when his walk rates tanked into an area of concern, a trend that has persisted over the last year as Schmitt has made his big league debut. Schmitt’s difficulty adjusting to offspeed pitches in the zone and breaking balls below it generated worse-than-average swing-and-miss rates in 2022 (his under-the-hood contact data is worse than his raw strikeout rate), and it's a big reason why he's running a sub-.300 OBP so far in the big leagues. Sub-optimal swing decisions (he chased at a 33% clip in 2022 and is doing so at a whopping 48% in the big leagues as of list publication) have negatively affected the type of contact he's made, even though he did hit 21 homers last year.
Schmitt’s swing is a dead ringer for Anthony Volpe's, down to his closed-off setup and deep knee bend timed to the pitcher’s release, shifting his weight to his back leg before exploding toward the ball. This swing is designed to get under the ball consistently regardless of where it’s thrown, which makes Schmitt’s low average launch angle (more than 10 degrees lower than Volpe’s) and high groundball rate confounding. A lot of it is just poor secondary pitch recognition. Most of Schmitt’s minor league success came off of fastballs. At Double-A, he posted a 1.073 OPS on heaters, which accounted for 49% of the pitches he saw. Meanwhile, his slash line against offspeed and breaking balls was an anemic .216/.286/.333. Now that he’s seeing more offspeed and breaking pitches – and major league caliber ones at that – he’s struggled to make consistent, hard contact.
No write-up of Schmitt would be complete without singing a few bars of praise regarding his defense, which is really the bedrock of his prospect foundation and the biggest reason why he's still going to be a good big league role player. His instincts and hands at third base are tremendous, and he sweetens it with elite arm strength. He's seen a lot of big league time at shortstop and we don't think that's a great long-term fit, but it makes sense as a way of keeping Brandon Crawford fresh and gives Schmitt an opportunity to play all over the infield and develop as the utilityman he's likely to be.","P7KkeThVrZo","27577"

Even as his surface-level performance has been strong at virtually every level, there have been issues implied by his TrackMan data and visual flaws in his swing, both of which have made it hard for him to hit for power in games and may make it tough for him to hit big league pitching at all. Mitchell has above-average raw power and will flash it on occasion, but his swing makes it tough for him to elevate consistently, especially to his pull-side. He has a swing-and-miss hole in the top third of the zone and tends to only be able to put the ball in play on the ground in the bottom third, giving Mitchell a mistake-hitter look when you dig into his spray chart. The industry has been waiting for a swing change that might bring out the power more consistently, but that hasn't happened yet. A pro's physique, big strength, and straight line speed give Mitchell the appearance of high-end athleticism, but looseness, fluidity, and grace aren't part of the package. Some of what he's able to do on a baseball field leaps out at you, especially when Mitchell is hauling ass into the gaps, but athletic malleability does not appear to be one of them. Center field defense is easily Mitchell's most impactful tool. It's hard to find players who can actually play a big league center field and Mitchell is quite good out there, and he has an above-average arm. He shares many similarities with Bradley Zimmer, though Mitchell's plate discipline should enable him to perform like a 45 FV outfielder more consistently than Zimmer has.","hR-lcCg8R9A","27555"

He barely has enough raw arm strength for the left side of the infield, but his quick hands and internal clock typically enable him to lob the ball over in time. A very aggressive swinger who has run walk rates in the low single digits throughout his career, Sosa is especially prone to chasing sliders off the plate, which he did at a 39% clip at his various 2022 stops according to Synergy Sports.

Marsh's fastball doesn't hop even though it has the approach angle and spin axis of a fastball that typically does; it has below-average vertical break and might be surprisingly hittable against big league bats. Marsh seems aware of this and has been pitching backwards pretty often in 2023, using all three of his secondaries early in counts before elevating his fastball when he's ahead. His breaking ball command is quite good, and Marsh's ability to mix his pitches evenly and do so in pretty much any count makes him rather unpredictable.

Palencia’s fastball stood out from the jump, as he was sitting 97–99 mph immediately during backfield activity. His heater still sits 98–99 and frequently tops out in the triple-digits with late life, a near-elite offering that plays down due to his middling control. His two secondaries include an above-average slider that he throws hard enough (it averaged just south of 90 mph in 2022) to make up for its generic shape. He hasn't yet been able to locate any of his three offerings consistently, and that erratic control carried over to 2023, with Palencia starting the season as a Double-A starter who maxed out around three innings (the last time he lasted longer than four innings was back in June of 2022). After five starts there, he didn't pitch in a game for a couple weeks, then reemerged as a single-inning reliever at Triple-A. Since the promotion and reassignment to the bullpen, he's gotten wilder, but he’s still garnering a lot of swinging strikes, both in and out of the zone. 
Listed at 5-foot-11, Palencia has a maxed-out, muscular frame that might not age well athletically. The combination of power and fluidity he shows in his mechanics (even though he doesn't have consistent feel for release right now) is akin to Pirates righty Luis Ortiz, who is similarly built and has been able to withstand a starter’s workload while maintaining upper-90s velo. While we buy that he'll hold his stuff under a starter’s load of innings, Palencia hasn't proven it yet. He may indeed be better in small, electrifying doses, and that seems to be the avenue the Cubs are exploring with Palencia at the moment. His big league debut came in extra innings on July 4. In both of his frames, he retired the side in order, while his defense threw both zombie runners out at the plate, which means in two full innings, he’s only faced four batters while recording his first big league win on just 12 pitches. His fastball sat 98-99 and touched 100 several times, with his slider garnering big league chase at 90 mph.

The Padres gave him $2.6 million to turn pro rather than go to Vanderbilt, and a year and a half later he was traded to the Rays as part of the Tommy Pham/Jake Cronenworth/Hunter Renfroe deal. Edwards had to wait another 18 months to make his Rays debut thanks to the pandemic and some oblique issues, but he looked fine when he was finally healthy and he remains a career .300 hitter in the minors. He was squeezed off Tampa's deep 40-man roster and traded to the Marlins ahead of the 2022 roster deadline in a four-player swap in which Miami parted with two young pitching prospects. 
After he had played the middle infield and a little bit of third base with the Rays, the Marlins have Edwards playing only second base and seeing his first career action in center field in 2023. Having positional versatility is key to not only maximizing his big league role, but to having one at all. Edwards isn't a great defensive second baseman and and because he doesn't have the arm to fit on the left side of the infield, a trial in center field makes a lot of sense. So far Edwards looks fair in center. His reads are a little tentative and he'll make your eyes pop out of your head when he peeks at runners before he's actually secured fly balls in his glove, but generally Edwards looks pretty comfortable considering he's learning a new position on the fly at the Triple-A and big league levels.

He's had a velo spike, added a second breaking ball, been moved back and forth between the bullpen and the rotation, and has dealt with a couple of injuries dating back to college, which limited him to just 28 innings prior to his draft year. At times, Sheehan's delivery seems deliberate and out of sync, which is largely where his relief projection comes from, though the balance and power he shows in his lower half and the way he gets down the mound are indicative of a special level of athleticism. After some early 2022 time on the IL, Sheehan was dominant late in the summer with Great Lakes, stringing together several good five- and six-inning starts in August before a promotion to Tulsa and a Fall League stint. 
His heater features big carry through the strike zone, making it a potential plus-plus pitch if he can sustain the mid-90s velo that comes and goes depending on how well synced his delivery is in a given start. Sheehan has leaned more on his changeup since turning pro. He threw more curveballs (a pitch that's been de-emphasized but that Sheehan still uses occasionally) than changeups in college, but the latter is what garnered more swings and misses. An invisible parachute pops out of the back of his changeup as it approaches the plate, and hitters flail over the top of it. Sheehan doesn't have great feel for his newer slider, but that pitch is still in the nascent stages of development; at times it's harder and looks cuttery, while at others it looks like a typical slider. From one point of view, Sheehan's history of injury and his atypical mechanical look funnel him toward the bullpen; from another, <a href=""https://blogs.fangraphs.com/the-dodgers-emmet-sheehan-is-a-fast-rising-pitching-prospect/"" target=""_blank"">his ability to make adjustments on the fly</a> despite relative inexperience might continue until he's a complete starting pitching prospect.

In spite of his long arm action, Brito throws a ton of strikes and has an above-average power-sink changeup in the 85-89 mph range, which he turns over from a tilted-out, high arm slot à la Michael Wacha. He runs it away from left-handed hitters and often uses it early in counts as a way of inducing weak contact. Neither of Brito's two breaking balls is especially nasty, but he commands both his upper-70s curveball and mid-80s cutter/slider to his glove side with consistency, which should enable him to work hitters who struggle to identify those pitches. Like Randy Vásquez, Brito's size and delivery are not typical of a big league starter, but he's sustained strong velocity across over 100 innings and thrown enough strikes to put himself in the big league picture as a starter. He's a capable spot start option right now and would be fine pitching toward the back of the rotation if injuries force him into extended major league action in 2023.

A former top 100 prospect, Santos then spent most of 2022 at Triple-A, with two brief big-league stints, but his year ended early in late August when he was shut down with a groin injury. His slider is truly electric and generated a 42% whiff rate in 2022, but his high-velocity fastball's movement and shape don't allow it to miss as many bats as those of other triple-digit flame throwers, and so even to get ahead of hitters, he relies more heavily on his slider, using it more than half the time.

Aside from some pre-draft bullpens, he didn't pitch as a junior, and spent the rest of the year finishing rehab and working on secondary stuff in the 'pen. The Dodgers, a team that tends to take risks on rehabbers who otherwise wouldn't fall to them if healthy, popped Grove in the 2018 draft's second round; he was the first player taken that year who wasn't on our pre-draft ranking.
Since then, Grove, like lots of Dodgers pitchers, has been handled pretty gingerly from an innings standpoint, with his 90 IP in 2022 representing the most of his career. Perhaps that means Grove wouldn't throw quite so hard if he were working like a typical starter, but he has thrown harder since his pro debut, going from the 90-93 mph range up to 92-95 and peaking at 98 in 2022, when he made a handful of major league spot starts. He's the type of starter who would hold down a five-and-dive role in most teams' rotations, but with Los Angeles, he's on the fringe of the active roster. Grove has a vertical arm slot but tends to work with downhill plane toward the bottom of the zone, which makes his fastball pretty hittable in there and causes him to nibble. It does, however, help him set up his plus slider, which looks like a fastball near the bottom of the zone until it bends beneath it. His curveball, which he tends to land in the zone, has big depth and different shape than the slider. The breaking ball utility here is diverse enough that Grove has a starter's repertoire even though he barely throws a changeup. It's a no. 4/5 starter's repertoire with a low projected innings count that slides him into more of a fifth starter's projection.",,"23221"

He mixed in his upper-80s changeup at a higher rate in 2022, and its usage saw an additional uptick upon his introduction to the A’s organization, perhaps an indication of their efforts to improve his viability as a starter. He favors it particularly against left-handed hitters while relying more heavily on his occasionally nasty low-80s curveball against righties. Neither secondary is very consistent. Command has always been of concern for the righty, and it took a turn for the worse upon his arrival in Double-A Midland, where he issued 22 walks in just 20.2 innings to close out the season. Even though he walked more than a batter per inning at Triple-A to start 2023, the big league clubs' neediness led to Medina's promotion, and he's been a consistent member of the big league roster since mid-May. Like several Oakland pitchers, he has served as both a starter and a reliever, but his bullpen appearances have all been in long relief, taking over in the second or third inning after truncated starting performances from others (so, essentially, starts). His command still dogs his output, with an above-average walk rate illustrating his inconsistency at finding the zone. On a good team, Medina would probably have already been put in the bullpen, and his stuff would likely enable him to perform well in that role, but the rebuilding A's have no incentive to make such a move proactively.","dBX2qSyxwIU","21649"

His arm strength is average coming off the TJ and his exchange further dilutes pop times in the 2.05 area. His glove hand is slow to match pitch location, making it tough for him to make borderline pitches look like strikes when the pitcher doesn't hit his spot. On a knee with the bases empty and in a high crouch with runners on base, Amaya is also not a sticky ball-blocker and gives up lots of long rebounds that allow runners to advance. He hasn't progressed as predicted when he first broke onto the scene as a quick-moving teenager who looked like a shoe-in to catch, but the time off is a good reason for him to suddenly be behind. Still, important development is going to have to be compressed into Amaya's next 10 months. The 2023 season is his fourth and final option year, so he needs to progress enough as a defender for the Cubs to feel good about permanently carrying him as their backup. 
The good news is that strapping catchers built like Amaya are the sorts who tend to break out in their late 20s, à la Tyler Flowers. A swing grooved through the bottom portion of the zone will likely prevent him from being an average contact hitter, but his on-base skills and meaningful power (for a catcher) already make him more a more dangerous offensive player than your typical backup. There's enough of a gap between the typical primary big league catcher's defense and Amaya's current glove to forecast him as a bat-first backup early in his career, and some of his career history (so much time missed) suggests the finer points of the defense have a chance to arrive later on.","C4d6ThYGLvs","21693"

He slashed .268/.333/.375 in college, not great for what had become a corner outfield prospect. Over time, the Pirates moved him back behind the plate, increasing his reps until he was mostly catching (while playing some left field) in 2022. Sabol has raked through the minors, but as an old-for-the-level regular, culminating in a huge 2022: .284/.363/.497 with 51 extra-base hits as a 24-year old at Double- and Triple-A. After a fair Fall League stint, the Pirates decided not to roster Sabol and exposed him to the Rule 5 Draft, which is how (after a trade with the Reds) he ended up with San Francisco, a club often intrigued by guys who can catch and do other stuff. 
Sabol's arm strength is okay, but it takes him so long to get out of his crouch that his pop times often play in the 2.05-2.15 range, which is not good. Among the many changes the Giants made to his approach back there is that he's more likely to cut it loose from his knees, Erik Kratz style, as a way of avoiding how long it takes to get his huge frame up out of his crouch. Sabol used to be a stiff, one-knee'd receiver, but the Giants have him moving around much more, sometimes starting in a traditional crouch before going to a knee as the ball is in flight (or about to be). It's a better look than what he was doing with Pittsburgh, but we just won't know exactly how well Sabol can throw until he gets more reps with his new style. In his big league innings so far, his back-picks to first and his throws on attempted steals of third have been from his knees, whereas he’s gone back to popping out of his crouch on throws to second. The results haven’t been favorable, with the long pop-times to second resulting in a lot of successfully stolen bases. It's important for Sabol to catch part-time because he likely doesn't have the hit tool to profile as a corner outfielder. He has thus far performed around league average, albeit with a high strikeout rate, while splitting his time between catching and playing left field. He's a super cool role player, a backup catcher plus a little more.","4vS1hRf5E1g","25805"

Fermin's athleticism on defense has long carried the water of his profile. His framing, arm strength, and ball-blocking are all average or better, while Fermin's feel for contact has enabled him to post sub-20% strikeout rates throughout his minor league career. Fermin can ambush up-and-in pitches with power, an ability he’s demonstrated in a small big league sample so far. His hard-hit rates in 2023 (both at Omaha and in the big leagues) are comfortably above his 2022 rate, suggesting he's become a bit stronger in his late-20s. Fermin's damage can be limited by working away from him, and he has a tendency to chase a bit more than average, but a 50-grade hit tool with the occasional pull-side homer would make him a luxury backup at worst and probably a low-end regular during this window in his prime.",,"21840"

His lack of command and mechanical violence both push him to the bullpen, but Olson's arm strength and secondary pitch quality are both strong enough to consider him a special, multi-inning relief weapon. 
Olson has had real trouble throwing strikes, especially with the fastball. While his surface-level walk rates improved drastically in 2022, visual evaluation of his feel to pitch and command was still pretty damning, and Olson's strike% with his fastball (a paltry 59% in 2022) was very low. Part of this is due to Olson's inefficient approach with the heater, which he tries to blow past hitters at and above the letters. His changeup has incredible action, sinking and tailing away from hitters with huge movement for a pitch that bends in in the upper-80s. His breaking balls span the low-to-mid-80s and also have lovely, two-plane shape and enough depth to be considered above-average pitches. Olson mixes his secondary stuff in pretty liberally and can go at hitters with all kinds of different pitches, he just does so with zero precision. Olson is now on the 40-man roster in his first option year and it makes sense for the rebuilding Tigers to give him as much time as possible to iron out his strike-throwing issues and, hopefully, profile as a five-and-dive type of starter.

While he had a near ideal pitcher's frame, his tightly-wound delivery could never really be reined in, and after seven years of starting, Soriano finally transitioned to the bullpen in 2023. 
Soriano had Tommy John in February of 2020, and then Pittsburgh made him the first pick in the 2020 Rule 5 Draft knowing he'd likely be on the shelf for a huge chunk of 2021, which arguably made him easier to roster for the required time in order to retain him as a long-term prospect. He came back to make minor league rehab appearances in May, but his velo tanked into the low-90s after just a few innings. He had blown out again and needed a second Tommy John procedure in June of 2021. The Pirates returned him to the Angels in November to clear roster space. The timing of the second TJ meant Soriano could only throw a handful of innings in 2022. 
Assigned to Double-A Rocket City in 2023, Soriano was moved to the bullpen and struck out 12/9 IP there across 23 walk-addled innings before he was promoted to the big leagues. Soriano's stuff is great. His sinking fastball touches 100 and he has a plus-plus curveball that averages a whopping 86 mph. It's a dominant reliever's two-pitch mix undercut by Soriano's mechanical stiffness, which impacts his control. It's delightful to see him healthy and thriving after he had a weird and frustrating three-year window clouded by the pandemic and injury.

In Memphis, he raked throughout 2022 (.331/.372/.532, yowza) and earned a 16-game big league cup of coffee in September, as well as part-time big league role early in 2023. So far in the majors, Burleson's surface-level statistical performance has been poor, but his peripheral data (a measly strikeout rate and an xwOBA of about .320 across nearly 200 plate appearances) suggests that he's due for positive regression and is closer to a league-average hitter. Despite a consistently low walk rate in the minors, Burleson was a ZiPS Top 100 prospect in the offseason, but eyeball scouts (including the two of us) have tended to round down on him due to concerns about his medium- and long-term athleticism and mobility, and where that might leave him on defense. 
Burleson's swing-happy approach is also a concern (he had a 58% swing rate in 2022, which is extremely high), but so far that hasn't turned into a jump in strikeouts against big leaguers. The total lack of patience is the one thing standing between Burleson and a John Kruk comp. Burleson can really hit. He's adept at moving the barrel all over the zone and hitting the ball hard without an elaborate mechanical operation, and his swing becomes even simpler with two strikes. He can get on top of up-and-in fastballs, though he sometimes strangely inside-outs them to left field. He also tends to take pitches down and away from him the opposite way, with enough strength to do extra-base damage in that direction. 
He lacks great ball skills in the outfield but Burleson does have a plus arm, as you might expect given his two-way amateur pedigree. There's enough here to project him in a strong-side platoon role in one of the outfield corners (normally a 45 FV grade), though we're rounding down a little bit here to account for what we anticipate will be an earlier decline phase.",,"27615"

In his short 24-game stint to close out the major league season, he maintained the anemic offensive numbers that characterized his time in the minors, struggling mightily to make meaningful contact and recording just five hits in 70 plate appearances. There are examples of players who took time to finally tap into their in-game power, like Tigers catcher Jake Rogers, whose bat lay dormant for a couple of big league seasons before suddenly erupting into a 21-homer season last year as a 28-year-old.

He was often throwing harder than that in 2021 at Miami of Ohio, sitting 96-97 most of the time and touching 101. The huge uptick put him firmly in the first round picture. Some teams thought he should go close to pick 10, while others had him slotted closer to 40 due to relief projection and his injury history (hip, shoulder). He's had further health issues in pro ball (back, biceps). After 26 walk-prone innings with Rocket City to start 2023, he was promoted to the big leagues and moved to the bullpen.
Bachman utilizes a slider-heavy approach in the extreme, as his 63% usage is top 10 in the majors among pitchers with at least 10 innings. It looks and plays more like a cutter in the strike zone, and has almost exactly zero vertical and horizontal movement. It's most obviously a slider when Bachman is locating it for swings and misses. Because he uses his mid-90s fastball as more of a chase pitch than one geared for in-zone strikes, Bachman will probably always be walk-prone, but his true talent for strike-throwing is better than what he's put on paper so far in 2023. He has more or less scrapped his changeup so far in the big leagues, but if Bachman is going to be more than just a generic middle inning guy, that has to be a part of his repertoire, if only to give lefties a third thing to worry about.

He still pounds the zone with his fastball, though, and Curry maintained the modest uptick in velocity that he showed in 2021.

Seabold throws a ton of strikes with his fastball and slider, which has become his go-to secondary. His slider, which tops out around 87 mph, is unusually hard for a guy whose fastball sits about 92. Seabold can also turn over a good low-80s changeup, which used to be his best pitch; while it still induces its fair share of chases and whiffs, it is closer to an average pitch than plus.

France attacks with a heavy dose of four-seamers and cutters, with the former riding above the zone while the latter has late action to his glove side. The cadence of France's delivery tends to catch hitters by surprise, as it is complete almost as soon as it starts, causing his fastball to jump on hitters on first look.

The mid-70s curveball breaks almost straight down, while the slider is between it and the cutter.

Julks followed that up with a 31-homer campaign with Triple-A Sugar Land in 2022, but his .270/.351/.503 line was only good for a 108 wRC+ in the hitter-friendly PCL. He played his way onto the big league roster during the spring of 2023, and even though the Astros' right-handed redundancy makes his presence there tenuous, Julks should get to enough power to play a small, short-side platoon role in an outfield corner throughout his career. 
His swing is geared to pull in the extreme, and Julks is great at snatching inner third fastballs even though his leg kick is big and elaborate. He's going to pepper the Crawford Boxes with lots of hard contact — so many of his 2022 homers were tucked into the left field corner. As you might guess because he's so pull-heavy, Julks tends to swing inside a lot of sliders. He has the athletic ability to bend at the waist, dive to the outer part of the plate and power the ball the other way, but it's rare for him to stay on sliders long enough to do that. You'll see oppo pop more often on middle-away fastballs. Though not an especially good defender, Julks has a strong arm. He's a nice complement to a lefty-hitting platoon partner of some kind, but the Astros don't really have that on their active roster.",,"20311"

A lack of barrel control and in-zone vulnerability against letter-high fastballs means he will likely end up with a 40-grade hit tool at best, and one source was also bothered by his breaking ball recognition. A lefty-hitting outfielder with this kind of power, even with a below-average hit tool, is typically a solid big league role player as the larger half of a platoon. Outman's feel in center field is only fair, and while he can play out there in a pinch, he's better suited for right field, where he played all but a few times during the back half of 2022. Of all the outfielders who figure to be competing for a 2023 big league roster spot, only Outman and Jason Heyward hit left-handed, making them a particularly good fit with some combination of the righty-hitting Chris Taylor, Miguel Vargas, and J.D.

His hard-hit rate (41%) is a shade above the big league average, which is true of most of Canzone's power-measuring underlying metrics, but his contact rates tend to be a shade below (he's a bit of a bucket strider and can open up too soon on stuff breaking away from him) and he's a corner-only defender. The defensive component likely played a role in Arizona leaving Canzone off of their 40-man roster while they added Barrosa and Fletcher, as Canzone's offensive ability is about the same as the latter's. He still projects as an above-replacement corner platoon bat, probably one of relatively low impact because the power isn't monstrous.

Still, he’s maintained a mid-teens (or lower) strikeout rate at every stop in the minors and combines that with an impressive ability to make contact throughout the zone to offset his miniscule walk rate. He also hit for more power in 2022, which is a welcome addition to his offense, especially if he ends up as a corner infielder. After debuting last season, he's played a couple dozen games at the big league level in 2023, striking out more often than he had in the minors (though still not at a concerning rate), but also belting four home runs, all on hanging sliders left over the middle of the zone. He was sent back down to Triple-A at the end of May and seems to be focusing on refining his swing decisions; over a comparable sample, his 7.9% walk rate since returning to Las Vegas is nearly triple what it was in the majors, where just two of his 72 big league plate appearances resulted in a walk.
Diaz has historically been hard to place defensively. He’s got the arm strength for third but not the range, he’s on the small side for a first baseman, and he lacks sufficient speed for the outfield. As a result, the bulk of his big league innings in 2022 were spent at second base, where he’d spent virtually no time in the minors until 2023. While a move to the keystone could shift his profile from that of a corner bench player to an everyday roster presence thanks to his proven bat-to-ball skills, the introduction of the shift ban may mean that the range concerns that pushed him away from third base follow him to the middle infield and diminish his viability there as well. His ability to make contact should enable him to be a part-time, low-impact infielder at a few different positions.","cvGGb4kbXNc","22650"

Beck has three different breaking balls (a cutter, slider and curveball), and he pitches off of them frequently, with as much as a 15 mph gap between his cutter and curveball.

His 94-97 mph fastball will bump 99, rushing past hitters at the top of the zone, while the pace and cadence of Herrin's delivery is very difficult for hitters to time, which is a big part of how he generates such weak contact. He can be very vulnerable to right-handed hitters when mis-locating the slider in the strike zone, but that pitch has pretty absurd length for a mid-80s breaking ball and is comfortably a plus pitch that will be death to left-handed hitters late in games. The shape and length of that pitch varies enough that it's possible Herrin has both a slider and cutter, but his delivery is wacky enough to assume it's just natural variation.

He's different from Kieboom (lever length) and Kiura (simpler footwork) in meaningful ways, but that entire group (and Downs) has had issues with letter-high fastballs, which Gonzales often swings underneath. He seems able to make some mid at-bat adjustments to this type of pitch but then ends up playing a guessing game with breaking balls. Overall, there is a ton of in-zone swing-and-miss happening here. There were only three big league hitters with 100 plate appearances who had sub-70% in-zone contact rates in 2022 (Chris Morel, Brett Phillips, Eli White). Gonzales had a 68% Z-contact% as a 23-year-old at Double-A.

There isn't anything about Lukes’ batted ball data to suggest he made changes that led to this uptick, nor is there anything in the visual evaluation of his swing compared to 2021. Even if the power uptick isn't necessarily real, Lukes does have lovely feel for contact. He’s tough to make swing and miss (83% Z-Contact% in 2022, 80% overall contact%), and he's adept at letting pitches on the outer third travel deep into the hitting zone before he swats them down the third base line for doubles.

In addition to his running, low-90s fastball, Gaddis has developed a more consistent slider (the pitch he most frequently locates where he wants to) to pair with his screwball-style changeup, which sometimes has upwards of a 15-mph velocity delta from his fastball. He also occasionally lobs in a very slow curveball.

He was the first pick in the 2022 Rule 5 Draft and has stuck on Washington's roster. So far, he's been a walk-prone multi-inning reliever.  
Ward can carve at times with his cutter/slider combination, with the latter featuring massive sweep. He attempts to set those pitches up with a low-90s sinker, but it’s his worst pitch, and he might end up needing to pitch backwards against big league hitters. He has flashed a solid changeup as well, a pitch some feel he should use more in early counts to keep hitters from timing his fastball. Strike throwing and pitch efficiency were issues for Ward before the elbow injury, and can be the last things to come around when recovering from arm surgery. He may ultimately be a starter, but given that he’s coming off just half a season and a TJ rehab, it makes sense for Ward's innings count to start his big league career in a long relief role and see how it goes.

Without a true plus pitch, McArthur looks more like an up/down depth option than a true on-roster, middle-inning archetype.","gIN9kzUaMlA","21527"

He maintains stilt-like height throughout the duration of his tall-and-fall delivery, and he throws from a true three-quarters arm slot that generates huge downhill plane. Hjelle has had a little velo spike in 2023. His curve is the slowest-spinning curveball in the big leagues, averaging about 1,850 rpm compared to a big league average of over 2,500. The Giants altered his release of the pitch this season, and it now has more drop than before and has garnered whiffs at a better-than-average rate despite its lack of spin. A tertiary changeup rounds out a spot starter's mix, but Hjelle is more likely to work in long relief over time as his options run dry. His size disorients hitters, especially on first blush, and his tendency to generate groundballs makes him a candidate to come in with traffic on the bases, get a grounder, then work another inning.","51af5JjxsT4","21481"

Spending all season at Triple-A, he put up decent numbers, striking out roughly a quarter of opposing batters and allowing just four homers all season. He mixed in four pitches, with his four-seamer and slider accounting for 88% of his pitches, and the changeup and two-seamer bringing up the rear. His four-seamer was around the same velo as it had been at the alt site, sitting comfortably at 93 mph and maxing out at 95. He spins the hell out of everything that leaves his hand, in particular his slider, which averaged over 2,700 rpm, but his inability to fine tune his command puts a damper on its utility (his walk rate was an untenable 12.4% across his 75.2 innings of work). Indeed, of his offerings, only his four-seamer had a whiff rate above the big league average, and he struggled to keep that pitch competitive, only throwing it for a strike 57% of the time. His chase rates were at or below league average across the board, further emphasizing the troubling command. His delivery is violent and scary, especially given the injury track record, though not all of his injuries in the past have been to his arm. His arm action is very long, and he bends at his torso as he lunges toward the plate, allowing for more extension during his release, but also creating an uncomfy angle that adds stress to his shoulder.

Ramos has filled out in a way that has impacted his mobility, which perhaps should have been anticipated given that he has had a bowling ball build since high school. He's slowed down to the point where not only is he a corner-only defender, but he's not an especially good one right now. Combine that with below-average plate discipline and in-zone contact ability, and you're looking at a fringe big leaguer. Ramos still has dangerous power and tends to inside-out the baseball to right field in the air with impressive force. He struggles with high fastballs and swings over top of secondary pitches, including many that finish in the strike zone. If he was a lock to get to his power reliably, then Ramos would still profile in a prominent big league role, but he tends to drive a lot of his contact into the ground. His average launch angle is below 10 degrees and his barrel rate is comfortably below the big league average even though his exit velos are pretty big (his hard-hit rate was 45% in 2022, for example). If that power can be actualized, then we're talking about a short-end platoon outfielder. If not, it's tough to project a consistent big league role for Ramos.","ytZlP4TQI48","22515"
