1,1,"Adley Rutschman","BAL","C","MLB",2022,"70","Med",,"24.6527777","6' 2""","220","S","R",2019,"Draft","BAL",8100000,"Oregon State","Rutschman is a complete, franchise-altering prospect, and one of the most exciting young players in the entire sport. He's a switch-hitter with a hit/power combination that would probably make him an All-Star anywhere on the diamond, while also being a plus defender at the most demanding position in baseball, and an intense, vocal, charismatic leader. His track record of superlative statistical performance and unanimous scout adoration has continued uninterrupted for nearly half a decade now, and in our eyes, he is in a tier of his own as the best prospect in baseball. 
From the fall after his freshman season onward, Rutschman went wire-to-wire as the consensus top prospect in the 2019 draft. He ended up slashing .353/.473/.559 throughout his career at Oregon State, where he also briefly kicked for the football team, and stood apart from the other members of Collegiate Team USA. To nobody's surprise, he was drafted first overall in 2019 and signed for an $8.1 million bonus. Because of the pandemic, 2021 was Rutschman's first full pro season. The Orioles sent him straight to Double-A Bowie, where he slashed .271/.392/.508 and earned a promotion to Triple-A Norfolk. Across the entire season, he hit .285/.397/.502, with nearly as many walks as strikeouts and 50 extra-base hits. In the middle of all that he went to the Futures Game, where his batting practice session was among the loudest and most impressive of the elite talents there. He'd switch sides of the plate mid-session and just start sending balls into the Coors Field seats without needing any swings to get comfortable from that side. Rutschman's swing is absurdly athletic for a guy his size and even though it's often an effortful cut, he barely ever whiffs, posting a 6.7% swinging strike rate in 2021, among the best in the minors. That mark would rank Rutschman 16th among qualified big leaguers in 2021, slightly better than Jose Altuve and Justin Turner in this particular statistical department.  
Rutschman catches from a traditional squat but will sometimes fall to one knee as he's receiving a pitch to improve its presentation to the umpire. He's extremely strong and can frame pitches at the bottom of the strike zone without letting his target sag below it first, which lots of other catchers need to do to frame pitches there. His best pop times hover around 1.90 and are right on the bag, though Rutschman's longer levers and big frame can sometimes mean a few extra tenths to get out of his crouch when he has to reach across his body to catch an errant pitch on steal attempts. His fiery on-field makeup is tailored to the situation. Sometimes, he calmly shepherds pitchers along; sometimes, he's in full Brian Dawkins mode, lighting a fire under the team and the crowd. 
Rutschman is a nearly-perfect prospect and inspired internal discussion about whether he deserved to be our second-ever 80 FV player. We decided against it largely due to the nature of the catcher position, which tends to reduce the number of games played and often comes with (sometimes long) fallow offensive stretches due to the physical toll catching takes. There's also a little gap between Rutschman's measured raw power and his visual report, and his barrel rates in 2021 were a little below the big league average. Adley makes a ton of contact but not always on the sweet spot of the ball, leading to what we anticipate will be all-fields doubles spray rather than elite home run totals. Still, he projects as a perennial All-Star and consistent MVP threat, the next decade's best catcher in baseball.","J9NFZSjsaEQ","26288"
2,1,"Bobby Witt Jr.","KCR","SS","MLB",2022,"65","Med",,"22.2972222","6' 1""","205","R","R",2019,"Draft","KCR",7789900,"Coleyville Heritage HS (TX)","Witt's development is occurring at a rate that would make Ocarina of Time speedrunners envious, as the Royals effectively skipped the prodigiously talented shortstop over both A-ball levels and sent him right to Double-A Northwest Arkansas to start 2021, his first full season of affiliated ball. Witt, who began the year as a 20-year-old, responded by hitting .290/.361/.576 across a season split evenly between Double- and Triple-A. He amassed 72 extra-base hits, 33 of them home runs, in just 123 games and swiped 29 bases at a 73% success rate. The 33 dingers were good for fourth-most in all the minor leagues, trailing only Marlins prospect Griffin Conine (their dads were briefly teammates in 1995) and org-mates MJ Melendez and Nick Pratto. 
Witt has had more than a half decade of uninterrupted excellence and he looked the part, both physically and fundamentally, among big leaguers during the 2020 summer camp and alternate site period, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a known elite prospect as a high school underclassman thanks to his combination of physical gifts and poise, eventually going second overall behind Adley Rutschman in the 2019 draft. His hit tool was nitpicked leading up to that draft, which was natural considering that the mix after Rutschman was Witt and several premium hit tool guys in Andrew Vaughn, C.J. Abrams, and Riley Greene. Witt's underlying data suggests there are still some nits to pick in this regard, as his swinging strike rate (14.3%) was worse than average in 2021, and he has historically had issues swinging inside on the outer edge. That, in particular, has plagued Witt during his early big league tenure, as he's chased breaking balls at a roughly 40% clip, much worse than the big league average (28% on all pitches). But because he's a viable defensive shortstop, has big raw power, and has shown that he's going to get to that power in games, Witt need only have a 40-grade hit tool to be a star, and he looks like a lock to be at least a 3 WAR player annually even if that's where things settle. 
He performed exceptionally well against velocity while with Omaha, slugging .800 against pitches 93 mph and above (albeit in just a 77-pitch sample), and was especially adept at turning on heaters up-and-in there. But that hasn't carried into 2022, and Witt had just a 28 wRC+ against big league fastballs as he graduated from prospect eligibility, which happened not long before list publication. Instead, he's been doing most of his damage against hanging breaking balls. 
These issues are consistent with the growing pains of all but a few truly elite players who debut around this age, and aren't a cause for alarm so much as they're key data points to monitor for improvement. Witt still projects as a 30-homer threat at a premium position, and generates Trevor Story and Willy Adames comps because his frame resembles theirs more than it does those of the XL Tatis/Correa/Seager types. Witt became even more like Story late in 2021 when his throws to first lost some zip. It wasn't so bad that he was at risk of moving off of short, but it was something to keep an eye on at the start of 2022. While at times his throwing stroke looks atypical, these issues seem to have resolved and Witt has consistently made strong, accurate throws to first, at times using his athleticism to do so in spectacular fashion. Witt has experience all over the infield and debuted as a third baseman, but became the favorite to receive the lion's share of shortstop reps when Adalberto Mondesi tore his ACL. Mondesi's injury was a body blow to the Royals' defensive flexibility but doesn't impact Witt's projection at all, and it might actually relieve some of the mental load that would have come with playing all over the field and help him make necessary offensive adjustments more quickly. Once that happens, he'll be a power-hitting star shortstop and the face of this franchise's resurgence.","t9XYmBesagk","25764"
3,1,"Julio Rodríguez","SEA","CF","MLB",2022,"65","High",,"21.7555555","6' 3""","228","R","R",2017,"J2","SEA",1750000,"Dominican Republic","While Rodríguez hasn't turned out to be a completely polished, impact big leaguer from day one, keep in mind that he's the age of most college draft prospects and raced through the minors amid a season lost to the pandemic as well as overhauls to his swing and physique, all while still performing at an elite level (independent of his age). This all started back in 2019 when the Mariners skipped Rodríguez over two levels and sent him to full-season ball at their bygone affiliate in West Virginia. While perhaps a bit chase-prone, he dominated the Sally League, was promoted to High-A Modesto late in the year, and finished strong there before he looked heavy and gassed in the 2019 Fall League, where he was running in the 4.4s. Sequestered at the alternate site in 2020 (where he suffered a fractured wrist), he wasn't seen again in anything resembling a normal competitive environment until the 2020-21 Dominican Winter League, where the most advanced pitching he had ever faced exposed his middling breaking ball recognition (more on that shortly). By that time, he had already begun to lean down and run faster (he's running in the 4.25-4.3 range at this point), though it wasn't until after that LIDOM jaunt that Rodríguez's swing would be overhauled into the version you see today. Sent back to High-A in 2021 (this time in Everett due to the reshuffling of the minor leagues), he slashed .325/.410/.581 while striking out 21.6% of the time and walking at a 10.4% clip. Upon his promotion to Double-A, he improved in almost every category, recording fewer strikeouts and more walks while slashing .362/.461/.546 over 46 games. On only two occasions did he go two or more consecutive games without recording a hit, and never more than three. Rodríguez spent time away from affiliated ball representing the Dominican Republic as part of the Summer Olympic Games, first in June for the qualifiers, then later in the summer for the Games themselves. 
That he was able to hit among all these stops, starts, and long bits of travel — and with a relatively new swing — was incredible. This new swing (his hands once set up similarly to Juan Gonzalez's, and are now akin to Brandon Marsh's) may not stick long-term. This version struggles to get on top of letter-high fastballs, instead tending to foul them away, and Rodríguez's front foot was striding open and leaving him vulnerable to well-located sliders on the outer third of the plate, though this has gotten better. Opposing big league pitchers have been trying to exploit this during Rodríguez's debut. As of publication, he had seen a lower percentage of fastballs than all but six other qualified hitters and the fourth-highest percentage of sliders. Julio's natural tendency has been to pull off of sliders, and he often pulls on the ground even the ones he makes contact with on the outer edge of the zone. It's tough to ask him to more regularly dive to the outer part of the plate and try to drive the ball to the opposite field since his swing is already vulnerable to high fastballs, and committing to the outer third in a way opposing batteries can identify would leave him more vulnerable to getting blown up by fastballs in on his hands when he guesses wrong. It takes special feel to hit for a player to alter the way they use their lower half based on what they're seeing, reacting while a pitch is in mid-flight. At the very start of his pro career that seemed like something Rodríguez was doing naturally, so either we were wrong about that or his current swing doesn't allow for it. Again, Rodríguez has done nothing but rake in the minors despite these issues. He has enormous talent and drive to succeed, and is likely an adjustment or two away from being the dominant, heart-of-the-order force we expect he'll be. For now, his speed is his carrying tool. Among the Statcast Sprint Speed leaders (a metric that measures peak speed), Rodríguez has been running 4.25 from home to first per Baseball Savant. That's an above-average time per the traditional 20-80 run time scale and is plus in actuality, which has helped mask his lack of experience and middling instincts there. Would Rodríguez be playing center field on most rosters right now? Probably not, and at his age and his size, he still projects to a corner outfield spot long-term, but the more important takeaway is that this young man basically willed himself into being a passable option there by altering his training with speed in mind. That seemingly indomitable aspect of his personhood will likely find a way to dial in what's happening on offense.","fm1zz74sRbc","23697"
3,1,"Gabriel Moreno","TOR","C","MLB",2022,"60","Med",,"22.6305555","5' 11""","210","R","R",2016,"J2","TOR",25000,"Venezuela","As much as any prospect could break out during the dark 2020 minor league season, Moreno broke out. He was fairly well-regarded coming out of 2019, then was seen on alternate site video, during instructs, and later in the Venezuelan Winter League, where he hit .373/.471/.508. The length of his year was as close as any catching prospect came to replicating a full season behind the dish in 2020, and there was already enough buzz at that point for us to include Moreno on last year's Top 100. Then 2021 began and Moreno started on an epic tear, slugging .650 at Double-A New Hampshire before missing a couple of months with a fractured thumb. He ended up playing in just shy of 40 regular season games, then picked up reps during the Arizona Fall and Venezuelan Winter Leagues. 
The visual evaluation of Moreno's power does not support the idea that he can slug .500, his career mark. One could argue that's because he was most widely seen coming off a hand injury that might dilute his power, but his batted ball data from before the injury also indicates his Double-A output was inflated. You can't fake an 11% strikeout rate, though, which is Moreno's career mark. While he's an aggressive hitter who sometimes takes fundamentally unsound swings, he has 70-grade bat control and tends to find a way to poke, spray, and slash contact all over the field. He can square high-end velocity, and though his overall hit tool grade projects below his raw barrel control due to his flawed approach, there's enough offense to make him an All-Star offensive performer at catcher. He also has rare speed for the position and has an overall skill set like that of a less-toolsy Jason Kendall. Defensively, Moreno catches on one knee until there are runners on or there are two strikes, then sets up in a very wide crouch as if he's always preparing to block a breaking ball in the dirt. He'll sometimes finish on one knee in an effort to frame a pitch on the edge, even if he didn't start there. He popped in the 1.95-1.98 range during Fall League, a slightly above-average range of times for throws down to second base.","kZMLKOcWFe4","22664"

Greene was sent to Double-A to start 2021 with just 24 games of full-season pro baseball under his belt, coming off a year spent facing alternate site pitching over and over again. He responded by hitting a combined .301/.387/.534 across the two levels. That kind of performance is astounding, and bolsters long-standing industry resolve that Greene has special hitting talent. His swing has a controlled ferocity (Greene has remarkable lower half flexibility) that creates all-fields spray, and comes with enough raw juice to put balls out toward either gap. His strikeout rate has been a little higher than is typical for someone with such a sterling on-paper track record, and he swung and missed at more in-zone breaking balls while he was with Toledo than we would have guessed. But again, Greene was only 20 and at Triple-A. His amateur prominence allowed him to show off the way he thinks about hitting, which we consider reason enough to expect he'll make adjustments if he ever has to. While unathletic in some ways (we have him projected to an outfield corner), Greene is a fish in water where it matters most: in the batter's box. We think he'll hit enough to be a multi-time All-Star.",,"25976"

The first overall pick in the 2020 draft, Torkelson might not have had the breakout statistical performance some anticipated in his pro debut, but that speaks more to lofty expectations than actual results, as he reached Triple-A and showed he is nearly big-league ready after just 121 games of minor league experience. Torkelson has the potential to be an impact bat who hits in the three- or four-hole for a championship-level lineup. His raw power is near or at the top of the scale, but he’s also a sound hitter with a compact swing and feel for barrel control, with some scouts projecting a future plus hit tool once his closes up some holes at the bottom of the zone. His swing decisions are near-flawless, but he can get passive at times, waiting for the perfect pitch while laying off ones he has proven he can drive. While he never manned the hot corner in college, the Tigers dabbled with him there during the season, but the results failed to impress; he’s a low-twitch player with an average at best arm who is no more than a fringy defender at first base. Torkelson’s bat is his ticket to the big leagues, and it’s hard to find anyone who doesn't think he'll be a terrifying presence in the box for years to come and a strong candidate for 2022 Rookie of the Year honors.","3Q4wD3EV960","27465"

It's a slightly banal rephrasing of ""who ya got?"" between Cruz and the player the Pirates actually selected, Henry Davis, but framing it this way also helps illustrate Cruz's unique profile. Would a club really have spent the top pick of the draft on a 6-foot-7, 210-pound infielder? A player with a history of sub-70% contact rates? A guy who may or may not stick at shortstop? In this risk averse industry? 
Hell yes, they would. Or at least they should, in our view, given Cruz's jaw dropping blend of skills, tools, and upside. It's very rare to find a player with 80 raw, an 80 arm, and plus wheels. Cruz brings all of that to the table while playing a passable shortstop, which is remarkable even without accounting for his size. About that stature: obviously it's tough to be quick to the ball when your levers look like windmill blades. There is precedent for guys Cruz's height being able to hit, though, and he's significantly more athletic than Aaron Judge, Richie Sexson, and Nate Freiman. He's an explosive player and his wrists are strong as hell. He can impact the ball all over the zone and he actually had a below league-average strikeout rate in Double-A as a 22-year-old. And as Mychal Givens can attest, you can get Cruz off balance with a well-placed offspeed pitch out of the zone, and he still might send it to the Allegheny. He'll probably strikeout a fair amount due to an expansive approach, and we wouldn't be shocked if he moves to a different position as he heads into his late 20s, but if everything clicks that won't matter too much. Is there risk here? Yes. Cruz's approach can be reckless and immature. If he slides down the defensive spectrum and that never improves, he'll be on thin ice. He's also one of the few players in the minors with a feasible chance to become an 80, or at least have some 80-grade seasons amid season-to-season variance in performance due to his swing decisions.

They sent the electrifying Abrams to Double-A San Antonio at the start of 2021 after the 20-year-old had barely played full-season ball in '19, his draft year. Abrams responded by hitting .296/.363/.420 during two healthy months with the Missions. Then he fractured his left leg and sprained his MCL in an infield collision with Eguy Rosario in late June, ending his year. There was hope that Abrams would recover in time for a Fall League assignment, but he only played during a narrow instructs window and suffered another injury, this time a bruised shoulder. That didn't stop the Padres from pushing the envelope again in 2022, as Abrams opened the year with the big league team; at that point, he had played just 42 games above A-ball. His relative inexperience showed during a month-long debut stint while the Padres waited for some of their veterans to come off the IL, as Abrams hit .182 during that span. Given the context and sample size of that performance, there isn't much to draw from his struggles.
The catalytic qualities that make Abrams an exciting young leadoff hitter were often evident even amid these performance woes. Still a hit-over-power prospect by a comfortable margin, Abrams has started to fill out without losing any of his impact speed, as he's running in the sub-4.2s coming off his injury-addled 2021. Abrams' swing is geared to lift pitches down-and-in. He can flatten his path and get to pitches in other parts of the zone, but tends to spray those pitches the other way. As he continues to fill out and get stronger, he might be able to put balls out to left field and do a ton of damage in the opposite field gap. Both the way Abrams' bat traverses the zone and the way his head kicks back like the butt of a shotgun when he really lays into a ball evoke Kenny Lofton, and Abrams also turns a fair number of bunts and infield choppers into base hits, à la the should-be-HoFer. While he hadn't generated a ton of early-career data because of the pandemic and injuries, it's becoming clear that Abrams' approach is more expansive than is ideal. He tends to offer at pitches out of the strike zone that can dilute the quality of his contact. That will need to improve for him to attain his ceiling as one of the more dynamic leadoff hitters in the sport. 
On defense, Abrams' hands, actions, and arm accuracy are all below average. They're not so bad that Abrams definitely has to move off the infield, and aspects of his defense (especially his arm utility) have improved since high school even though he has missed a lot of reps. Over the last decade or so, speedy infield prospects with similar issues (Billy Hamilton, Roman Quinn) have tended to end up in the outfield, but to this point, Abrams has only played a smattering of big league innings in right, with the vast majority coming at shortstop and second base. Regardless of where he ends up, it's a virtual lock to be an up-the-middle position, where Abrams' contact ability should be enough for him to be a good everyday player, while his looming power is what could make him a huge star.","UhCOxi0kL08","25768"

The big story was Baz's improved control. Coming into 2021, he had a career 23.9% strikeout rate and 11.6% walk rate, which he bolstered with extreme velocity, including occasionally hitting triple digits. His low-effort, repeatable delivery has been changed so that Baz is throwing from the stretch all the time.  
Historically, Baz has presented two distinct versions of himself. The first is that of a starter who sits in the mid-90s with a four-pitch arsenal, the Baz that was present at the 2020 alternate site, where his lower velocity might be at least partially attributed to the less-competitive atmosphere. The other is that of a high-90s flamethrower with a more limited repertoire. In 2021, Baz combined the best of those profiles while in the minor leagues. He started the year at Double-A, where he struck out over 40% of the batters he faced against an absurd 1.6% walk rate – that’s just two batters in 32.2 innings. He was promoted in June and continued to dominate at Triple-A (with a brief hiatus to snag Olympic silver) before making his major league debut in September. He went five-plus innings in both of his first two big league starts, with his fastball velocity in the 96-98 mph range even into his later innings of work. But in his last start of the regular season against the Yankees, as well as his ALDS start against the Red Sox, he struggled to keep his pitch count down, unable to get big leaguers to chase with the same consistency he had against batters in the minors. He was also punished on several mistakes where he missed his location and left pitches over the heart of the plate. Still, no matter how hot the spotlight, Baz never seemed to sweat. That composure will be useful, even if he ultimately proves unable to more reliably miss bats multiple times through the order and ends up a high-leverage reliever. He had arthroscopic surgery in the spring of 2022, perhaps heightening those chances. No matter — reliever Baz would probably still be an elite closer.","-j3khhUBqgI","22264"

He allowed four home runs in his Triple-A debut, but settled into a dominant streak after that, culminating in his best outing of the season: 6.1 innings in early August during which he struck out 10, allowing just one walk and one hit. His season tapered off a bit after that, and by mid-September, Greene was showing signs of fatigue (his velos began to dip) and he was shut down, having reached his innings cap for the year. His Triple-A stat line wasn't as dazzling as what he did at Double-A; his strikeout rate slid (though to a still-impressive 28.6%) while his walks increased above the 9% mark and his home run rate nearly tripled. He came out throwing extremely hard again this spring, sitting 99-102 throughout his major league camp outings, and while his fastball was once again strangely hittable at times, he clearly deserved to break camp with the big league team; he made his big league debut just prior to list publication.
Greene’s arm slot is back in the three-quarters area after dropping down at the 2020 alternate site, which should give his fastball more vertical hop, enabling better playability in the top half of the strike zone, though the shape of his heater still isn't great and needs to be above the strike zone to really get whiffs. The return to this arm slot will also help him get on top of his upper-80s slider and create vertical depth on that pitch; at the very least, this two-pitch combo means Greene can be an elite late-inning reliever if it comes to it. His changeup can get whiffs from lefties on occasion, and even though he only threw it about 4% of the time in 2021, he showed consistent feel for locating it to his arm side while he was at Louisville. Recall Greene was a two-way high schooler, he's missed a year due to Tommy John, and made the weird posture/arm slot change at the alt site amid virtually no real 2020 season. These factors, plus Greene's supreme athleticism and great looking delivery, make us want to keep projecting on his changeup enough to consider him a future star starting pitcher.

Peña is a plus defensive shortstop with above-average instincts, footwork and hands to go with a solid-average arm. He can get a bit aggressive at the plate, but he shows a consistent ability to drive the ball, and while he was ranked preseason with the hope that he could one day reach 20-plus home runs annually as a big leaguer, he is already on pace to do that in his first year and blow through this FV projection, which was made prior to Peña graduating. His makeup is off the charts, and he works as hard as he plays, with a quiet intensity to his overall game. Will there be any sort of regression here? Given Peña's propensity to chase, it's possible that he'll have dry periods like the one Luis Robert is having this season; his rate of breaking ball chase (45% — the league average overall chase rate is 32%) in particular has been notable and might be something big league pitchers look to exploit. But his defense ensures that even if Peña goes through similar stretches, he'll still be a solid everyday performer at a bare minimum. He is more than filling Carlos Correa's shoes and has been worth a win more than the incumbent as of list publication.","YRrhsdBsxBo","21636"

His numbers improved slightly after being promoted to Triple-A and the Royals put him on the 40-man after the season. Melendez is still probably going to swing and miss quite a bit. His new swing has a lot of moving parts — he swings with big effort, with a wide open stance and a sizable leg kick, and his hands have been lowered for the second time since signing — and Melendez has a tendency to pull off of offspeed stuff away from him. But he covers the bottom two-thirds of the zone pretty well and is adept at getting deep into his lower half to reach down and barrel low pitches. Some of his swings at inside pitches look like a tennis player backhanding a ball. Mostly though, he is incredibly strong, and capable of hitting balls out from foul pole to foul pole. The changes have unlocked the raw power that made Melendez so exciting as a high schooler, actualizing it in games. Having only previously played catcher during his professional career, Melendez played nine games at third base in 2021. While he occasionally would pick a short hop or make a barehanded play, he also struggled with throwing accuracy. Melendez had played two Triple-A games in right field as of 2022 list publication and is understandably raw out there, but he has also made a few fantastic plays. Some of this experimentation hints at issues with Melendez's defense behind the plate, but more importantly, it indicates that the Royals are looking for ways to get his bat into the lineup every day before Salvador Perez has vacated his role as their regular catcher (his deal runs through 2025, at least), though the two were sharing time prior to a Perez sprained thumb.
Melendez varies his crouch between a traditional one and dropping to one knee, mixing it up. In his 91 major league innings behind the plate, he’s thwarted three steal attempts, all with pop times under two seconds. All of those steal attempts came on pitches in or near the strike zone, but when he’s attempted to throw out a runner at second on a pitch that missed it by a wide margin, he’s airmailed the ball into center. His technique for blocking pitches in the dirt, even when the ball bounces in front of him, is to smother it with his glove, not relying as heavily on his chest protector or other padding as other backstops do. He does this skillfully, but occasionally it’ll result in the ball careening awkwardly off his body or skidding past him at an angle that may have been cut off by a more strategically positioned torso. There’s plenty of room for defensive improvement for Melendez, but he’s thus far proven himself reliable enough to afford the veteran Perez more time in the DH role in the short term and eventually become the everyday catcher.","jMI-XsZIgSA","22197"

Wielding one of the more athletic and dynamic swings in all the minors, Thomas' cut is a lefty mirror image of Jose Altuve's scissor kick, and he's adept at varying the pace and direction of his stride depending on pitch type and location while the ball is mid-flight. The sheer effort and explosion in Thomas' swing does lead to some swing-and-miss, especially against vertically-oriented fastball/curveball combinations, but his ability to make in-flight adjustments, his plate coverage, and the sheer quality of his contact lead to plus hit tool projection. That plus his speed (he routinely runs 4.1 seconds from home to first) makes him a candidate to lead off for the D-backs from some time in 2022 (though Thomas doesn't technically have to be put on the 40-man until after this season) until whenever Corbin Carroll arrives. Defensively, Thomas is okay in center field but not great, and his arm strength pushes him to left field if/when the team can roster a better center field defender. His speed allows him to glide from gap to gap with ease, but Thomas looks much less comfortable going back on balls straight over his head. Were we to list him as a center fielder, his defense grades would be 45/50, but in left field we think his speed makes him a plus glove. The total package is that of an above-average regular and a foundational piece of Arizona's future.","Bo9Wh47-Wm4","23792"

He maintained a puny walk rate during his time at Elon and on the Cape, and in his pro debut in 2019, he appeared in eight short-season games (23 IP) without issuing a single free pass. As of the lost 2020 season, that elite control bolstered a profile that included an otherwise run-of-the-mill mid-90s fastball and a number of secondaries. But at that year’s alternate site, Kirby’s velocity began to climb as he added strength to his 6-foot-4 frame, and at spring training in 2021, a new Kirby emerged, one who was now applying that well-documented control to a 97-99 mph heater. He had also made massive strides in developing his secondary stuff, which helped keep hitters off his fastball. He altered the grip on his changeup, which is consistently 10 mph slower than his heater, and while he hasn't gained enough confidence in the pitch to throw it very often, when he does, it comes without any noticeable change to his impressively repeatable arm speed. He’s added depth to his curveball, too, using it effectively against lefties, while relying most often on his hard, upper-80s slider, which breaks up an otherwise north-south profile with its horizontal bite.
In 2021, Kirby spent time in High- and Double-A, with a combined 5.5% walk rate against a 29.2% strikeout rate, allowing just one home run over 67.2 innings. If that innings total seems low, it’s because his starts were spread out, often by more than a week at a time, and he also missed two three-week stretches due to shoulder fatigue. He's been on a more typical schedule to start 2022 and continued to dominant and work efficiently at Double-A Arkansas for a month before the Mariners called him up shortly prior to list publication. This is not a guy with premium secondary stuff; instead, the biggest reason for Kirby's inclusion among the top 30 prospects in baseball is because he is a slam dunk, near-ready mid-rotation starter who, despite being handled with caution so far, we expect will work a huge load of innings thanks to how proactively he attacks the strike zone.",,"25436"

He couldn't make that leap and went just 3-for-38 before heading down to Triple-A El Paso for the rest of the 2021 season. Still just 22 all year, Campy hit an encouraging .295/.365/.541 with 15 homers while with the Chihuahuas, good for a 122 wRC+ in a Triple-A league with lots of hitter-friendly parks. While he has more risk than is typical for a prospect who has performed to this level at Triple-A, Campusano has rare offensive ability for the catcher position and an All-Star ceiling if some of his ills are cured with continued adjustment in the big leagues. 
The headline trait here is Campusano's plus-plus bat speed, which enables him to hit some epic pull-side homers and gives him 25-homer potential. When he connects with a full-effort cut, he has the look of Willson Contreras, who has performed like a 55-grade player to this point. An overly-aggressive, pull-heavy approach leaves Campusano vulnerable to well-located breaking balls, which he tends to swing inside. Breaking balls that don't quite finish out away from him get sent into orbit, though, as do fringe fastballs that catch too much of the zone. While he looked like a well-rounded offensive force in A-ball, Campusano is now tracking like a power-over-hit sort barring further adjustment. He has below-average plate discipline, but it's not so bad that we consider him at risk of taking a path similar to that of new org-mate Jorge Alfaro. The offensive bar at catcher is so low (collectively, big league backstops hit .228/.304/.391 in 2021) that Campusano projects to clear it pretty easily even if his current issues persist. 
While he's improved enough defensively to be a passable upper-level catcher, Campusano is still not a good defender. He now receives on one knee (even with runners on), which has helped him more comfortably frame pitches toward the bottom of the strike zone, but it borrows from his ball-blocking ability and can slow his exchange on throws to the bases (his raw arm strength is above-average). With the missed 2020 season in mind, it's feasible that Campusano can still improve as a defender. The rule of thumb is to take the long view with catchers and give proper weight to the scarcity of offensive performers at the position. This young slugger is now in a 40-man mix with Alfaro, Brett Sullivan (further down this list), and Austin Nola, an established big leaguer who has experience at other defensive positions. Because his 2022 focus is likely to be on becoming a better defender in El Paso, Campusano will probably graduate as an injury replacement this season, and then establish himself as a true everyday catcher with impact power later in his tenure with the Padres. The universal DH, as well as Austin Nola's versatility, perhaps give them some interesting options to find playing time for Campusano and Nola in a way that eases the burden on both of them and masks Campy's issues.","7iiD2O17Woo","22217"

He performed well above league-average at each of those stops in the way you'd hope an early first round pick would. He carried that momentum into the Fall League, where he slashed .318/.445/.489. In addition to the statistical performance piece, Stott showed improvement in his lower half's flexibility and general conditioning, as well as with his arm stroke, which used to be so atypical that it caused some concern among scouts while he was an amateur about his viability at short. Those have evaporated with the subtle improvements he's made. The question of Stott's in-game power lingers on, however; while he hit 16 homers in 2021, most of them came during his time at Double-A Reading, whose home ballpark is notoriously hitter-friendly. Stott has uncommon raw power for a shortstop but his approach has caused us to project his in-game power output below his raw. We still think that's true, but also think his swing decisions have improved enough to close the gap. He can adjust mid-flight to breaking balls when necessary, but he’s now better able to lay off the ones he shouldn't be swinging at in the first place. Lefty-hitting shortstops with this kind of power are tough to find and Stott is basically big-league ready. We expect him to usurp Didi Gregorius as the Phil's everyday shortstop at some point in 2022 and remain entrenched there for at least the next half decade.","OJO0sEV9iOg","26294"
37,1,"Michael Harris II","ATL","CF","MLB",2022,"50","High",,"21.5666666","6' 0""","190","L","L",2019,"Draft","ATL",547500,"Stockbridge HS (GA)","Harris was a switch-hitting, two-way high school prospect who many teams preferred on the mound because of his mechanical grace and ease, his fastball's action and angle, and his curveball's depth. He stopped switch-hitting as a high school senior (he had good feel for contact as a righty hitter but was much less explosive than he was from the left side) and while many teams continued to prefer him on the mound, the Braves were one of the clubs that viewed him as a hitter, so blown away by his BP during a pre-draft workout that they didn't bother to ask him to pitch during it. 
After they picked him, Harris went to the GCL and raked. Not only was his on-paper performance fantastic (.349/.403/.514), but so was his underlying TrackMan data, as both Harris' average exit velo and hard-hit rates were well above the big league average. Exposed to a fair bit of 2021 big league spring training, Harris played well and produced some amazing individual highlights. He hit an oppo homer off of Peter Fairbanks and made a running catch in The Triangle at Fenway South, then went to High-A as a 20-year-old and hit .294/.362/.436 in his first full pro season. There were some yellow flag attributes revealed during that season, mostly that (like Cristian Pache and Drew Waters before him) Harris is apt to chase, which not only impacts his OBP but also his quality of contact. Partly because he tends to expand and partly because of his swing's previous mechanics (more on that momentarily), Harris has tended to hit the ball on the ground too often for his power to really play in games. Combine this with the notion that he may not be a long-term fit in center (though he's a short-term fit and the best center field defender on Atlanta's 40-man) because we're talking about a compact young man with a very low center of gravity and a bottom-heavy frame who is arguably already at physical maturity, and you have the reasons why Harris was just outside our offseason Top 100 rather than firmly entrenched in it. 
Harris was a doubles machine during the first five weeks of 2022 and the Braves decided that he should leapfrog Drew Waters when Adam Duvall's legs seemed overtaxed in center, which was bleeding into his offense. They altered his swing shortly after Harris was called up, in the middle of their late-May series in Arizona. Harris' hands start and are loading much lower now, which may prevent him from cutting down at the baseball quite so much. It's only been about two weeks since he's made the change, and of the balls he's put in play since, roughly 52% have been on the ground, which still isn't great, but the fact that he's continued to hit big league pitching as a 21-year-old who's making a swing change on the fly is incredible. It's too early to draw any real statistical conclusions about what kind of impact this swing change will actually have on Harris' power output. It may enable him to hit more homers and/or exacerbate some of issues Harris has already had with in-zone, letter-high fastballs. This will become a key development should he indeed have to move to a corner outfield spot. It has tended to serve us well to wait for hitters like this to make a swing change and yield results before totally pushing our chips in (recently rounding down on Garrett Mitchell and Jarren Duran feels correct so far, and waiting for Pete Crow-Armstrong to show prolonged results with his new swing does, too), while we've been punished for anticipating change (50'ing Travis Swaggerty from the get-go). Harris was a Pick to Click in anticipation of him making some of these adjustments this year, we just didn't think it would happen at the big league level. The foundation for Harris to be an integral role player is basically already here: at worst, even if he moves to a corner, he's an oft-used fourth outfielder (this is the area where ZiPS has had him projected) in the Joc Pederson mold (there are body type and swing similarities with Joc here), while he still has star-level ceiling if Harris stays in center and this swing change makes a real difference.","2_32n4WPIJw","25931"

And while it doesn't have the backspin necessary to create carry up in the zone, his approach angle allows his heater to play as though it does. Bello mixes the fastball with two plus secondaries: a velo-driven slider that he threw with more consistent bite in 2021, and sneaky good changeup that falls off the table to miss bats from both sides of the plate. In 21 games (six at High-A, the rest at Double-A), Bello combined for a 32.8% strikeout rate and a 7.7% walk rate. His delivery is reliever-y, but the stuff is good enough to give him the edge, and he’s poised for a high-leverage setup role.","11F_rK9yABw","23920"

First basemen, even ones like Pratto with a bevy of secondary skills, don't have the luxury of whiffing that often and still becoming big leaguers because the offensive bar at the position is so high. But Pratto has altered his swing (most notably, his stance is open and he has a leg kick now) and had a huge 2021 spring, so consistently punishing fastballs at the top of the zone with power during the co-op period between big league and minor league spring training that at one point he was intentionally walked in what is understood to be a non-competitive, developmental setting. 
Pratto's swing has bad intentions. He collapses his back side to create lift and just swings as hard as he can at fastballs he can pull, selling out for power. It's very similar to Shohei Ohtani's swing mechanics, and this is a rare instance where we're projecting a player to out-hit their raw power grade even though their hit tool grade is below average. Pratto has always had a good feel for the zone and his ability to pick out pitches he can drive is quite good, so we like his chances of continuing to tattoo fastballs at the top of the zone, though we also think he is still really vulnerable to back-foot breaking stuff and anything running away from him with this swing. He hit 36 homers between Double-A Northwest Arkansas and Triple-A Omaha in 2021, but also struck out in almost 30% of his plate appearances. 
There aren't any first basemen who strike out even 25% of the time and still become what we would define as a 50 FV. Qualified first basement since 2015 with a 25% strikeout rate or higher include Lucas Duda, Matt Adams, Chris Davis, Brandon Moss, Eric Thames, Miguel Sanó, Mike Napoli, Pedro Alvarez — you get the idea. We had internal disagreement about Pratto being on this year’s Top 100 (opponents wanted him 45'd), but there was overwhelming industry support for his inclusion because the damage he does when he makes contact is elite, described to us as among the top 5% in baseball. While Pratto’s power has long been of the extreme pull variety, early into the 2022 season, there’s indication of an updated approach to his in-game power, specifically an increased ability to adjust to pitches and send them out in multiple directions. Less reassuring is his strikeout rate; it’s once again around the 30% mark, which is concerning despite the thump he’s showing, though he has buttressed it with a mid-teens walk rate. Pratto is an above-average hands and feet athlete at first base and he has a plus arm. He’s spent a good amount of time in the outfield so far this year and we think he has the feel and athleticism to play out there situationally, especially with so many corner thumpers occupying the Royals' 40-man and upper-level roster space. We're hoping that because Pratto was already able to make huge, career-saving adjustments, that he'll continue to do so and make enough contact to support an average everyday first base profile.","m12VQ7FD72k","22117"

In an analytics-driven world that favors north-south attacks, Lodolo bucks the trend with a low arm slot and one of the more extreme east-west approaches around. His fastball sat 93-95 mph in 2021 while touching 97, and though it’s notable for its sinking action, it also features incredible horizontal run, while his power breaking ball sweeps the other way to keep hitters consistently off balance. Analytics-driven assessments of his changeup are also glowing, and have it as the third of Lodolo's three plus pitches. While it's a little on the firm side in terms of velocity, it features big horizontal movement similar to his sinker, while also showing late downward bite. Visual evaluations of the changeup are not as glowing (Lodolo was one of the more divisive players we discussed during the construction of the Top 100), with some industry skeptics noting he only threw it about 9% of the time all year (""If you thought one of your pitches was plus, would you barely throw it?""), though that rate was up closer to 12% at Louisville. Whereas he used to only be able to land it in the zone for looking strikes, Lodolo has gotten better at finishing his breaking ball down and to his glove side, and it looks like a more viable weapon against righty batters now than it did while Lodolo was at TCU, so he has something to deal with platoon issues if it turns out the pitch-grading algorithms are wrong here. He looks like a slam dunk 2-3 WAR starter with a shot to be better than that if the changeup is real. We're betting on the former.","iUFDfzPzh74","26378"

Then Contreras missed two months with a forearm strain. His velocity was back upon his return (though he only went about three innings at a time after the injury) and Contreras pitched well at Double-A before making a pitstop in Indianapolis for one Triple-A start, then his big league debut towards the end of the regular season. He picked up more innings in the Arizona Fall League, where he had settled into the 94-96 range in our look, down a tick from the regular season. Contreras looked more like a low-variance fourth starter as a Yankees prospect, but this new velocity adds some ceiling to his projection. His fastball command is not as precise now as it looked before the new heat arrived, but Contreras still fills the strike zone up at an above-average rate and his fastball can generate whiffs in there. His two breaking balls — a mid-80s slider and low-80s curveball — are both consistently plus, have distinct shape from one another, and tend to be located more consistently than Contreras' fastball. Is there a weapon against lefties here? Contreras has a changeup but he barely uses it and it's below average in quality. The angle of his breaking stuff may not be suited for back-foot swings and misses against lefties, and he didn't garner a single swing-and-miss from a left-handed hitter in his Triple-A or major league starts, nor in the AFL outings seen by FG staff. His splits aren't damning, but the sample is too small to be meaningful, in part because of his injury. It stops us short of projecting Contreras to be a star, but he's still a mid-rotation starter who is ready to roll right now.","y0x_qpio0cg","22810"

In truth, he wasn't quite ready for the call, and a slew of tough opponents gave him a rough welcome to big league life. His 2021 performance simultaneously reflected the strides he's taken since draft day — including a modest velo uptick that quelled pre-draft concerns about his ceiling — while also underscoring a few developmental areas of focus going forward. While Detmers runs his fastball into the mid-90s, the pitch normally has average velocity and is without the spin characteristics that can help a four-seamer play up. He'll have to locate it more carefully going forward, because big league hitters tattooed it in 2021. Detmers will likely always be fly-ball prone because of how he uses his fastball (at the top of the strike zone), but it's when his location drifts into the meat of the zone that he gets in trouble. It's also worth noting that the lefty's spin rate dropped more than 200 rpms over the course of the season. That wasn't uncommon in 2021, of course, but it does rub a tiny bit of the shine off of his early season strikeout dominance in Double-A. 
Despite those issues, there's plenty to like here. We trust Detmers' longer track record of strike-throwing and still think he projects to have plus command, which could go some way toward ameliorating his home run problems. He also has a well-rounded mix of offspeed pitches. He'll toss a mid-80s sweeping slider to lefties and his fading change missed plenty of righty bats down on the farm, but it's the curve that's the real calling card. It's a low-to-mid-70s offering with a lot of spin and extremely long break. Even hitters who recognize it out of the hand have trouble keeping their weight back and staying on the pitch as it travels from the lefty batter's box to the other corner. While he needs a bit more seasoning, Detmers has three useful offspeed pitches, one of which looks like an unconventional out pitch. He projects as a low-variance mid-rotation arm.","mk06YYkpDQk","27468"

His big league appearances were bookended by two putrid outings, but Ashby was dominant besides those: 30.1 IP, 38 K, 6 BB, 1.78 ERA in 11 outings, mostly in relief. While many post-shutdown arms were unable to hold the velocity spike they exhibited during 2020 instructs or '21 spring training, Ashby was able to retain his 94-97 mph band. His fastball has swing-and-miss velocity but not swing-and-miss action, and instead has sinker shape that Ashby seemed to lean into during 2021, as his groundball rate skyrocketed to a whopping 65% combined between Triple-A Nashville and the big leagues. Working toward the bottom of the zone with his sinker may have helped him set up his changeup more consistently, as that pitch was once only flashing plus but is now consistently so. Ashby's changeup and slider (the latter of which had a 250 rpm jump in spin rate from 2019) are now both two-strike guillotines while his curveball is a show-me pitch that he barely threw in 2021. It may become more important if Ashby ends up back in the rotation. He may follow a trajectory similar to Freddy Peralta's and find himself starting eventually, or buttress the back of the bullpen if Josh Hader is traded.

He was 90-93 mph as an amateur, then was 94-95 in a handful of low-minors innings right after signing. Now he's been up to 101 mph and is sitting 95-97. Brash worked with four pitches as a starter at Niagara and continues to do so, the best being an upper-80s slider that has become a plus-plus offering. This is the pitch Brash has the best feel for, and he's consistently able to locate it to his glove side, where it moves the most and is the most enticing to hitters. He'll back that up with an occasional curveball (it was his fourth pitch in college but is third in line now) and changeup. 
The slider and velocity give him an impact relief floor (assuming health) but remember that we're talking about a small school prospect who missed what would have been his first full pro season of development due to the pandemic. There's big time variance here. Brash has a higher ceiling than Kirby because of the quality of his secondary stuff, but he also walked a batter every other inning in 2021 and has been down-shifted into a relief role in Triple-A after struggling with walks through his first handful of big league starts. Brash will probably be deployed in a high-leverage, multi-inning relief role in the short-term. That gives him the best shot to a) help the big league club right now, b) do so while mitigating some of the impact of his wildness, and c) retain enough of an innings foundation that he can move back into the rotation if/when he polishes up his command. Brash pitched 100 innings last season. If we were anticipating a typical year-to-year increase, that would have put him in position to work 120-130 innings as a starter this year, which is perhaps part of why he was given a big league rotation shot before Kirby, who is still building innings. If Brash works multiple innings in relief, he could still hover around the 100-inning mark throughout the season and be in a better position for a move back into the rotation than some of the guys who were yo-yo'd between starter and reliever during the ""Save Era"" window, when long relievers were more mop-up guys than impact pieces. In short, even if Brash ends up a permanent bullpen fixture, his stuff is so good that he belongs comfortably within the top 100 prospects.",,"25756"

He was part of the great Oregon State teams led by Nick Madrigal, Adley Rutschman, Trevor Larnach, and others, and Kwan was typically the leadoff hitter on those squads. He hit .329/.431/.418 throughout his college career and was barely regarded as a bench outfield prospect since he was a 40-grade runner who scouts doubted could play center field. Kwan walked twice as often as he struck out in college, but hit just three career home runs, an extreme skills-over-tools sort of prospect. 
Cleveland drafted Kwan in the fifth round in 2018 (former <em>Baseball America</em> writer Conor Glassey was the signing scout) and after a couple years of light-hitting performance commensurate with a bench outfielder, he exploded in 2021 and slashed a preposterous .328/.407/.527 combined at Double-A Akron and Triple-A Columbus. He was part of a huge contingent of prospects who the Guardians either had to add to the 40-man roster after the season or expose to the Rule 5 draft, and they ended up offloading roughly one-fifth of their 40-man to create space for Kwan, among others. Of that prospect contingent, several players (Jose Tena, Richie Palacios) were sent to the Fall League, while the 24-year-old Kwan was shockingly part of Cleveland's instructs roster (a group that typically includes young, low-level players), which suggests that they knew what they had here and didn't feel the need to stress test Kwan like they did Tena and Palacios. Kwan has a 3.3% swinging strike rate since entering pro ball, the second-lowest in the entire minor leagues among players with at least 650 PA during that span, with Madrigal the only hitter ahead of him. His short levers and excellent hand-eye coordination make it hard to get him to whiff, and his ability to spoil pitches is reminiscent of Johnny Damon. 
While we don't think Kwan can slug anything close to .527, there have been mechanical changes to his swing that indicate he'll now have enough power to be a viable everyday big leaguer. His stance has narrowed, his leg kick has gotten bigger, and his hands load lower than they used to. His swing is positioned to ambush letter-high fastballs and yoink them into the right field bleachers, which we think he'll do 12-15 times per year. Kwan gets out of the box in a hurry and will post some sub-4.00 run times to first even though he's still not a blazingly fast runner. His instincts in center field are terrific and he's an above-average defender there now, though he could be plus-plus in a corner if Cleveland decides they like Myles Straw better out there (an update between the publication of the Top 100 and the Guardians org list: they do). Even if that ends up being the case, we still think Kwan is a 50 in the Brett Gardner mold. He broke camp with the big league club and got off to a white-hot start.",,"24610"

Short, stocky, and incredibly strong, Duran doesn’t get cheated on his swing, which incorporates every muscle in his body to produce bat speed, leverage and some of the best exit velocities both in the system and among players his age in the minors. He's at his best when he's getting extended and slamming the barrel into pitches up and away from him, which Duran can punish to all fields. His bat path is very flat and suited for impacting pitches in the top third of the strike zone. Duran shows signs of being able to get really deep into his legs to cover the lower part of the plate but he doesn't do that consistently and swings inside lots of sliders. Because his swing has so much movement and Duran has a tendency to chase sliders, a high strikeout total will likely always be part of the package. Once thought to be a prospect in the Dan Uggla mold, who'd slug enough for you to look the other way at his defense, Duran has become a viable defender at several infield positions (a 40 at shortstop and second, a 50 at third), and thrives most when he's put in a position to show off his arm rather than his hands and actions.

The first, his sophomore year at LSU, was because of a back fracture, while the other was due to the pandemic. He entered the 2021 season as a 23-year-old who had yet to play full-season ball, but we loved Smith's well-rounded game and his general profile (that of a contact-oriented lefty stick capable of playing the middle-infield), and considered him a high-floor 45 FV prospect. The Yankees were too conservative with his assignment (this guy should've just been in Somerset from the jump) and Smith hit his way out of Low-A in just a couple of weeks, then continued to mash at Hudson Valley to the tune of a .347/.454/.625 line in June. His power output started to fall off after he was traded to Texas in the Joey Gallo deal, looking more in line with the visual evaluations of his power, which are shy of average. But his secondary skills — plate discipline, defensive footwork and actions, versatility, procedural awareness, and Smith's general ability to excel at all of the game's nuances — make him a damn good all-around baseball player who we expect will find a way to impact big league games every day in Smith's version of the Chris Taylor/Chone Figgins/Ben Zobrist super utility role. If it weren't for the presence of Marcus Semien and Corey Seager (Smith is a better defender than both of them), he'd likely be an everyday middle infielder, but Smith also has experience at third base and began to get reps in center field in 2022, where he immediately looked comfortable. Combine this versatility with Smith's control of the strike zone and feel for contact, and he does enough to be considered an impact player even though he lacks power. Just because of age, Seager and Semien will both become more likely to transition to corner positions over time, but until that happens, Smith can spell them on occasion while also seeing time at at least two other positions, in essence playing every day.",,"26396"

He very rarely whiffs and has an uncanny ability to put his bat on the ball regardless of where the pitch is with his short, compact swing. As it often does with young hitters, this has resulted in an overly swing-happy approach, with Miranda rarely working the count and often making suboptimal contact on pitches he should have left alone. In 2021, though, he exhibited much more patience in the box, resulting in a bump in both walks and power, while maintaining an enviable strikeout rate in the low teens. Miranda hasn't found a perfect fit on defense, instead playing more of a utility role (he spent time at all four infield positions in 2021, as well as a handful of games in left field at Triple-A), but the power he’s tapped into could allow for the possibility of a more permanent corner-infield role.",,"20538"

He hit .323/.372/.470 as a 22-year-old at Double-A Akron but ran a .357 BABIP and only walked 4% of the time in a 41-game sample, as his season was cut short due to a labrum tear. He doesn't have much extra-base power and is limited to second base due to a lack of arm strength, so the defensive versatility feature that comes with other top 100 prospects like Austin Martin and Vidal Bruján is not present here.

Since then, Pache struggled to crack the Braves outfield even amid their many injuries, and the club prioritized giving at-bats to Abraham Almonte, Guillermo Heredia, and other players acquired via trade. He's struggled to make contact in limited big league time and hit just .265/.330/.414 at Triple-A in 2021. Pache was still just a 22-year-old, and that line was on par with the Triple-A average. Additionally, Pache's swinging strike rate came down from his concerning 2019 levels. He had a 17% swinging strike rate (if we 20-80'd swinging strike rates, that'd be a 30) then versus a 13% rate in 2021, just a little worse than the big league average. There were times when it appeared that Pache had made a swing change in 2021, with emphasis on getting his front foot down earlier, but this isn't consistent on tape. His walk rates have been near the bottom of the scale for many years now, but Pache's chase rates, per Synergy, were also close to the big league average while he was at Triple-A. Burying the lede here, recall that Pache's carrying tool is some of the best center field defense on the planet. Even though he sometimes appears to be in middling physical condition, his reads and lines in center are virtuosic, and as soon as he gets regular time there, he'll be a Gold Glove contender. He has the raw power to pull out 20 annual homers, and if he can do that toward the end of his pre-free agency years, he'll be an above-average regular, but we anticipate he'll be a glove-only, nine-hole hitter at the start. Traded to Oakland as part of the massive Matt Olson haul, he'll likely get an immediate big league opportunity in Oakland, especially with Ramón Laureano suspended to start the season.","ALCsGpZ1oiA","19948"

It was the first time that he hadn't experienced a whiff-prone adjustment period upon promotion, and his K% was lower last season than in any year since he was in rookie ball. He began 2022 on an epic heater, clubbing 15 homers in a little over a month at Triple-A Memphis even though his strikeout rate exploded. Up in St. Louis for the last couple of weeks, he has hit for power while producing a lower OBP. Thick and physical, Gorman has comfortably plus raw power at age 22, though his body is maxed out and I'd be surprised if there was another grade left in the tank even though he is so young. While he's had issues getting on top of fastballs at the top of the zone, there's enough playable power here that Gorman should produce like a heart-of-the-order thumper. 
The presence of Nolan Arenado and Paul Goldschmidt on the infield corners means Gorman is being shoehorned in at second base, where he isn't very good; his range, hands, and actions around the bag are all below average. He can make routine plays, though, and the Cardinals would be justified in running him out there situationally, even knowing that he's a 30-grade defender at the position. If he played there every day, he'd produce like a left-handed Dan Uggla. Gorman is a fringe defender at third and would probably be an average defender at first base with time. That versatility will enable him to shuffle around with Tommy Edman and Edmundo Sosa the same way Matt Carpenter and Paul DeJong did, getting Gorman's bat in the lineup most of the time and taking him off the field to prioritize defense late in games. While flawed, Gorman should get to most of his impact power in games and share time at several infield positions, including one up the middle of the diamond, which will enable him to produce like a good everyday big leaguer.","_2qk0vq7IEA","22263"

Bruján shared many traits with Ketel Marte: he's a switch-hitter with preternatural feel for contact, he's extremely tough to beat on the inner half because his levers are so short, he's an elite rotational athlete who was able to make consistent contact while swinging as hard as he could, and he has the underlying physicality to come into impact strength as he enters his mid-20s. There are lots of other players whose measurable height and weight read as ""small"" who simply don't have Bruján's body composition (he's angular and tapered at the waist rather than built like a stick), musculature (you can see his lats through his jersey), or explosiveness, and he seemed like a candidate to grow into meaningful power later than other hitters. 
For the first several weeks of 2021, it appeared as though Eric was right, as Bruján hit .307/.402/.545 with a bunch of homers. He was merely a bit above average throughout the rest of the year, though, slashing .262/.345/.440 across the entire season, walking about as much as he struck out as a 23-year-old at Triple-A, setting a career-high in homers with 12, and swiping 44 bases. Bruján doesn't have the arm to play shortstop and the Rays began moving him all over the diamond with greater regularity. He played second base and all three outfield positions during a mid-year big league stint and also played some third base while with Durham. He has the long speed to be a very good defensive center fielder with time, but it's more likely that Bruján plays all over the place and adds value via his versatility. While he has gotten meaningfully stronger, he struggles with premium velocity. His righty swing has gotten better but lacks impact, and he can only damage the ball in a narrow part of the zone from the left side. Bruján is still going to spray lots of contact all over the field and ambush some weak inner-half fastballs while adding value on the bases and playing all over the place, so while he's unlikely to be impact offensive performer, he'll still be an impact player.","UBXDU4EcKOo","20536"

Three of his last four seasons had been tumultuous and strange. He dealt with blisters throughout the 2018 season, then turned in one of the most dominant minor league campaigns of the last several years in '19, during which Gore was in the top five in minor league ERA, swinging strike rate and strikeout-to-walk ratio among pitchers who threw at least 100 innings. He made 15 starts in the Cal League that season, and surrendered just nine runs. But in 2020, even when the Padres badly needed pitching at the end of the season, Gore languished away at the alternate site, struggling to synch up his mechanics. That carried into 2021, when Gore's season stopped and started a few times as the club tried to pare down his complex delivery to make it more consistent. Gore initially seemed athletic enough to maintain his deceptive, intricate mechanics, which featured him utilizing a huge leg kick while simultaneously raising his hands well above his head, then taking a huge stride down the mound and a long, plunging arm action way behind his body. Changes to his leg kick and arm action were evident throughout 2021. At times Gore's arm action was shortened to look much like Lucas Giolito's and the pace of his delivery from the windup changed, while his leg kick was reduced from the stretch. But these changes weren't a remedy for his command issues, as he walked 34 hitters in 61 innings throughout the year. 
While he now seems to have permanently eliminated the glove raise above his head, Gore came to 2022 camp with something more closely resembling his old delivery, and his command has stabilized enough for him to have cracked the Padres' big league rotation as of list publication. Gore's fastball shape and velocity are enough survive him having imprecise command, but his secondary stuff lacks elite, natural nastiness and is more dependent on location to be effective. Each of his three secondary offerings has big league utility, with his upper-70s curveball functioning as a get-me-over pitch and his upper-80s slider having the right kind of angle to miss bats against hitters of both handednesses when it finishes to Gore's glove side. He lacks precise feel for consistently locating his changeup, but it has enough action to miss bats on the occasions that he does, and while a lot of them tend to sail on Gore, he almost never misses with the pitch in vulnerable areas of the strike zone. 
When the group of us who worked on the preseason Top 100 discussed the struggling or injured pitchers who were on the bubble, we were unanimously scared of Gore, whose issues lasted long enough for us to consider it more of a trajectory than a swoon. That has turned out to be wrong. It still looks like Gore will have stretches of strike-throwing inconsistency from time to time, but not enough to prevent him from being a mid-rotation starter.","7bZP4Vs1QhA","22201"

As a 6-foot-5, square-shouldered hurler with a repeatable delivery and an arm slot well suited to optimizing his fastball, the velocity bump was a welcome development, especially when combined with the spin he’d added to his curveball and the arm-side action he’d begun to cultivate in his changeup. In 2021, Winder started the season in Double-A and managed to improve upon his '19 performance in virtually every statistical category. He issued more strikeouts (31.3%) and fewer walks (4.8%), while posting a 0.93 WHIP and a sub-two ERA. When he was promoted to Triple-A, he struck out seven guys before allowing a hit.

At age 23, he was a little old for a bat-only prospect who split the year between High- and Double-A, but his numbers there were incredible. He walked nearly as much as he struck out (he only K'd 13% of the time) and he has such precise feel for contact that we think he'll get to all of his modest raw power in games.

Similar to teammate Sixto Sánchez, the heater’s shape and movement cause it to play down, and it isn’t an elite offering despite having elite velocity. Cabrera adds a plus upper-80s slider that features so little downward movement that it almost seems to be rising compared to most breakers, though he has been working more with a low-to-mid-80s curveball that may usurp his slider as his go-to breaking ball. Cabrera’s best pitch is a killer changeup that while on the firm side, typically in the 90-92 mph range, features very low spin and significant fade and tumble. His command and control, both of which were firmly in the average bucket as a younger minor leaguer, regressed mightily during his brief 2021 time in the majors, which may have been a result of him being amped up or simply trying to get too cute around the edges to avoid his fastball getting hit. He has sufficient pitch execution to profile as a starter. 
Cabrera has an All-Star starter's stuff, and Reds starter Luis Castillo presents pretty good mechanical precedent for someone like Cabrera succeeding, but there are obviously questions about his ability to hold up over the course of an entire season, as between injuries and conservative workloads, 100.1 is the most innings he’s thrown in a season, and that was all the way back in 2018.",,"21690"

In 2022, he is enjoying his third consecutive season of increased velocity, going from the 92-94 mph range in '20 to averaging 95.7 during the '21 minor league season, climbing throughout the year and sitting 97 during his late-season big league debut; he now sits at a whopping 98.7 mph, topping out at 102.5. Strider's moniker is appropriate considering that his delivery is so explosive thanks largely to his powerful lower half, while his arm stroke looks almost effortless. Additionally, Strider's fastball has big carry and flat angle, making it a dominant, 80-grade pitch that should at least enable him to be a great late-inning reliever on its own. His slider, which was reworked during his TJ rehab to feature more vertical action, is still below-average and not nasty enough to miss bats in the strike zone. It is hard, typically in the 83-87 mph range, but has short movement. I was at a start in which Strider, while facing a D-backs lineup of entirely left-handed and switch-hitters, threw changeups 22% of the time. In his four 2020 starts, Strider threw a total of 13 changeups, and the '21 minor league pitch data we were sent by a front office contact had him throwing changeups just 3% of the time. While he does appear to slow his arm speed when throwing the changeup, Strider's fastball arm speed is already so (seemingly) low-effort that he might get away with it, and while he lacks feel for locating his changeup consistently right now, that pitch shows at least as much potential to become a bat-missing offering as his slider (at least it did during my in-person look against the D-backs). 
This is definitely a one-pitch guy right now, and at age 24 you'd typically have no compunction bucketing him in a bullpen role. Even if you isolate his fastball usage as a starter (68%), it's way above that of Carlos Rodón (63%), whose heater usage is currently tops among qualified starters. But this is an elite pitch we're talking about, and while it runs counter to his secondary deployment so far, we think there's room to project on Strider's changeup (he's had so few reps due to his TJ timing, the pandemic, and then being put in a relief role for a while), enough to hope he'll eventually have a second above-average offering and have a shot to continue to start. In the meantime, the raw power and quality of his fastball will be tested by better lineups that know how to make adjustments and anticipate its line once they've seen him once or twice through the order.

He kept the ball in the zone more than ever in 2021 while also seeing his velocity tick up, leaving more evaluators than ever convinced he can stay in a starting role. Bradish’s unique delivery, which features a dramatic hip tilt in his load, creates equally unique (and effective) fastball shapes, as his over-the-top release produces nearly perfect backspin on one of the more vertical fastballs around. Once sitting in the low-90s while touching 95 mph, Bradish now parks his fastball in the 94-96 mph range, and while the qualities of the fastball make it quite difficult to locate within the lower half of the strike zone, he uses the upper half to great effect. He complements the fastball with a pair of good breaking balls, with his downer curve giving him a classic vertical attack and a sweeping slider adding a horizontal aspect to his game. Bradish's firm changeup is on the fringy side, but good enough to be utilized in the right places. Nobody is going to call Bradish precise, and he tends to rack up high pitch counts, but he’s cut down the walks enough to project as a five-and-dive type of starter who just out-stuffs opposing hitters on the right day.

With a fastball that sits 90-94 mph, it was hard to understand the 37.3% K-rate (against just 6.5% walks) he'd posted in his 29 professional starts across the 2018 and ’19 seasons, not to mention his swinging strike rates, which were among the minor leagues' best. In 2021, he continued to build on that success. He started the year at Triple-A Durham as part of the Rays system, striking out 34.9% of opposing batters before making two impressive starts as a member of a Team USA squad that garnered a silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics. By the time he’d returned stateside, he was a Twin, coming over to Minnesota as part of the return in the Nelson Cruz trade. He made two Triple-A starts in St. Paul, striking out 50% of the batters he faced and earning a call-up to the big league rotation at the beginning of September. He made five big-league starts, and maintained a 30% strikeout rate at the top level, with just 5% walks.  
Understanding that success requires an examination of Ryan’s approach angle – he creates backspin that seems impossible based on his release point, thanks to a seemingly incongruously high arm slot and very short levers – which gives him the look of a starter, unlike other hurlers with similarly low releases. That deceptive approach angle allows his fastball to play up, with batters swinging over it, especially when he can place it in at their hands. His starter profile is further bolstered by a four-pitch mix, including secondaries that have oft been described as middling, but which also produce rare and promising spin; his curveball spin is a near-perfect mirror of his fastball, and his slider creates heavy seam-shifted wake, as Jake Malihot detailed in an in-depth look at Ryan during this past offseason. As Jake concluded, even if Ryan doesn’t make the adjustments necessary for his secondaries to play up, the characteristics of his approach angle and release point give him a wide enough margin for error. We're skeptical that Ryan can continue to work with his fastball 75% of the time and be a starter without major league hitters making meaningful in-game adjustments, but we think that he’s poised for big league success in a relief role even if that's true.","SJ3ozpjg-9g","21390"

It’s hard to know if Schmidt was ever fully healthy last season, as his stuff was below what he had shown in previous years. His two- and four-seam fastballs sat between 92-94 mph and were generally two ticks under the range he had normally shown in the past. His best pitch remains a low-80s curveball with strong, late bite, but he’s also brought an upper-80s slider back into his arsenal and it’s nearly as effective an offering. His changeup is firm but moves well. Schmidt’s injury history (he had Tommy John surgery in 2017) and lunging, unathletic delivery have many wondering if he’d just be better off as a reliever, despite his deep repertoire.

His frame filled out and his velocity became more consistent start-to-start, resting in the 95-99 mph range and touching 101 throughout 2019 and again during the first half of '21 before Duran was shut down with a forearm strain that cost him the rest of the year. He was throwing again during 2021 instructs (if we can call what most of the Florida teams did ""instructs"") but his arm strength wasn't quite back to pre-injury levels. While Duran's fastball has had more effective angle since the Twins acquired him, its non-velocity characteristics don't enable it to miss bats at the rate you might expect of a 97 mph fastball, similar to what Sixto Sánchez and Brusdar Graterol have exhibited during their respective big league tenures. The area where he most consistently gets whiffs is down and to his arm-side, with a unique splitter/sinker hybrid that Duran and the Twins call a ""splinker"" and that we have listed as a splitter here. While his curveball has good-looking depth, it's extreme velocity separation from his fastball (16 mph on average) and its high arc make it fairly easy for hitters to distinguish from Duran's fastballs, and it also lost about 200 rpm in 2021, which may have been due to the injury. 
After he had largely assuaged concerns about whether he could start by limiting his walks in 2018 and '19, Duran is back in the relief risk bucket because of his injury and some concerns about how his stuff will play the second or third time through a big league lineup. His delivery is very upright and kind of stiff, and he doesn't have pinpoint feel for location, but Duran bullies the zone with huge velocity enough to consider him a starter if that heat totally returns. He slid from being in our overall Top 100 (he'd made the cut in each of the last two years) to just outside of it, with his return contingent upon showing complete health in 2022.

Cabrera has become a power-over-hit utility prospect. He added mass in his lower half and traded some contact for power, resulting in 29 doubles in 2019 and then that big home run total last season. We've also learned more about how Cabrera's new physicality interacts with his defensive fit. He is now best deployed as a shift-aided second baseman. He has some of the best defensive hands and actions in the whole org, and a great internal clock, but he doesn't have the arm strength for the left side of the infield. He knows this, and tries to get rid of the baseball as quickly as possible even if it means making a fundamentally unsound throw. His first-step quickness has regressed with his uptick in power, and his range is pretty fringy, an issue mitigated by defensive positioning. While Cabrera has played 2B/SS/3B throughout his career, we have him penciled in as second base-only unless you can hide him at third here and there. 
Cabrera has developed average raw power, and his aesthetically-pleasing uppercut swing enables him to hit the ball in the air consistently and get to that power in games. But his free-swinging ways and the extreme nature of the uppercut, which leaves him very vulnerable at the top of the strike zone, are both round-down offensive traits. In the end we're still talking about a middle infielder with actionable raw power, so we think it's very likely that Cabrera turns into a key role player on the Yankees infield soon.",,"21707"

The Braves saved money on their picks in the top 10 rounds so they could splurge on prep prospects who slipped. Grissom wanted to be a part of the org and Atlanta scouted him closely all spring, convinced he could stick at shortstop despite a 6-foot-3, 180 pound frame that had many scouts assuming he'd move off the position. Since signing, he's added 30 pounds and is back to projecting more in the 2B/3B area, and it's possible he'll eventually see some time in the outfield en route to a super utility role. Grissom's bat-to-ball skills are advanced, enabling him to limit his strikeout rates to the 13-14% range. He can turn on inner-half pitches with over-the-fence power, while he takes more of a take-what's-given approach on pitches out away from him, knocking pretty, hitterish singles to right field.

Over the course of three years, he has added a better split/change and started throwing harder, and he sustained that velocity over 20 starts in 2021 before wrapping his year up in relief in the Arizona Fall League. Winckowski went from topping out around 94 mph to sitting there, and he sat 95-96 during short outings in Arizona. His best secondary pitch is a mid-80s ""slider"" that has such vertically-oriented shape that you may consider it a hard curveball. Those pitches don't always have big depth, but when they do, they look like ridiculous 85-86 mph curves and are clearly plus. Winckowski's changeup is also firm, often in the 89-92 mph range.

Jefferies can make his fastball sink and tail, ride and cut, and he occasionally dumps in a slower breaking ball in the 78-81 mph range as a change of pace offering. The whole repertoire, which is pretty vanilla except for the changeup, is bolstered by Jefferies' surgical east/west command. He's only walked about one batter every 10 innings he's pitched in pro ball, and if not for being constantly dinged up, he would have a pretty good case to be a 50 FV pitcher based on the innings workload that strike-throwers like this are typically able to tout (and the resulting WAR boost inning-eaters tend to enjoy).

Instead, he's poised to play a valuable multi-positional role with rare power and athleticism for a utility man. The Cubs continued to expand his defensive horizons in 2021, with Morel seeing time at all three outfield positions and second base while continuing to get reps at short and third. He relies heavily on his plus-plus arm strength to bail him out of infield situations created by sub-optimal range and defensive hands, which tend to be most palatable at third base. His outfield reads and routes are rough right now, but not bad for how little Morel has played out there, and are likely to improve considering his athletic gifts and excellent makeup.
Despite clear swing-and-miss issues, Morel posted a league-average batting line as a 22-year-old in Double-A, slashing .220/.300/.432 with 17 homers and 16 steals. He's most adept at punishing mistake breaking balls, and his high-end exit velos (about 110 mph) and barrel rate on balls in play (22%) were at about the big-league average.

Allen is one of the better defensive players in all of the minors. He’s a plus runner with outstanding instincts, quick first steps, smooth actions and more than enough arm to make plays from multiple angles. He’s seen considerable time at second base in his career, which has served to prepare him for the possibility of a future utility role as a big leaguer. Allen straightened up his stance in 2021, allowing his above-average ability to make contact to play better. He’s a bit of a free swinger, and while he’s found some occasional power, his overall pop remains well below average.

He hit .407/.538/.729 and had more walks than strikeouts during his career at Wright State but only hit an impressive sum of homers as a junior. It's likely teams' draft models discounted Burdick slightly due to his draft day age, which was well over 22, and the Marlins were able to pick him up for an under-slot bonus in the third round. He went out and crushed Low-A, with his triple slash line (.308/.407/.542) largely reinforced by his underlying data (an expected .276/.366/.490) and visual reports. As he's climbed the minors, his strikeout rates have ballooned into a scary area, climbing into the 30% range. His swing is geared for contact in the bottom two-thirds of the zone, as he just turns his top hand over and lets his gigantic forearms drive the quality of his contact. 
Indeed, almost all eyeball reports of Burdick begin with a remark about his physicality. His forearms are as thick as support beams and help him generate huge power; the closest contemporary body comp here is Tyler O'Neill. Even though Burdick is a thicker guy, he takes a pretty athletic swing that demands a lot of his balance through contact, but he never appears out of control, even when he's swinging his hardest. He sometimes strides open in a way that impacts his ability to cover the outer third of the plate and his bat path works in such a way that Burdick tends to shoot pitches in the middle of the zone the opposite way, which makes me kind of scared about whether he'll be able to turn on inner-half big league fastballs. Most of his big pull-side contact actually comes against hanging breaking balls. The biggest difference between Burdick and the other K-prone hitters you'll read about in this system is Burdick's ability to play center field. While he's seen time at all three outfield positions, he is fine in center and actually quite adept at going back on balls, and he's fearless around the wall, perhaps because he's an indestructible cyborg.

He spent 2020 at the alternate site, then had a hot '21 spring training, which earned him a spot on the Royals' Opening Day roster. He was quickly supplanted by Michael A. Taylor, and Isbel played so little in the big leagues in 2021 that he retained rookie eligibility entering this season. We still like him as the larger half of an outfield platoon, a big-league-ready role 45 player. While Isbel looks fine in center field and could probably play there every day if he had to, he's more likely to spend his career moving all over the outfield in deference to above-average or better defenders, which has been the case with Taylor. 
Isbel's carrying tool is his feel for contact. He was chase-prone during his 2021 big league debut, with a nearly 40% chase rate, but he seems to have corrected that issue, posting rates closer to 22% at Triple-A in '21 and '22 combined. He's a compact athlete with a compact swing, which helps him impact pitches middle-in and down, and makes Isbel tough to beat in the strike zone. As of list publication, he was running a 5.5% swinging strike rate in 2022, coming off a 9% rate last season. His home run damage comes to his pull-side, though Isbel is capable of peppering the opposite field gap with doubles power. He can't really put top-of-the-zone velocity into play, but he can get the bat up there to foul it off. While probably not a star, Isbel could somewhat outpace our FV projection by taking a Josh Reddick-like trajectory, where he still starts because of his defense but hits at the bottom of the order against lefties.","uDxxZ8QvMhY","21614"

Vavra had a statistical breakout during his junior year at Minnesota — posting a .386/.455/.614 line with 10 homers, and everything way up from his sophomore year — and has walked at an impressive 13% clip in pro ball while hitting a bunch of doubles and swiping nearly 30 bags in just about a full season's worth of plate appearances. He is adept at picking out pitches he can drive until he has to expand with two strikes, peppering the middle of the diamond with liners.

But Velazquez has other stuff going on that lends greater legitimacy to his 2021 performance, which culminated in a cartoonish .385/.480/.712 line and a Fall League MVP award. Several swing changes (leg kick gone, more conservative toe tap implemented, hands not loading quite as deep, shorter stride) and improved physical conditioning were evident along with the uptick in offensive performance, and Velazquez's batted ball profile shifted in a meaningful way, as his groundball rate dropped from 50% to about 35%. Once a power-goof flier, Velazquez is now a substantively different player. We expect his plate discipline, which had been an issue for him and was much better in 2021, to regress to his career norms and for Velazquez to be a low-OBP hitter, which means he's still relatively volatile. He may have some lean years because of his approach, but there will be others when Velazquez hits 25 bombs while seeing fairly regular duty in right field. He and Alexander Canario are similar players likely competing for short-term reps in Chicago now that they're both on the 40-man.","SHA70C1S_Ag","23359"

He's still a work in progress on defense, but Huff has persevered through myriad injuries to become a viable defensive catcher despite his size. He's gone from catching on one knee in most situations to catching on one knee all the time, even with runners on base or with two strikes. Huff's legs are so splayed out that even though receiving on one knee impacts his mobility, his legs and giant body act as a retaining wall that helps keep pitches in front of him (he does give up some long rebounds, though), and the deep one-kneed crouch helps him stay low and frame pitches near the bottom of the strike zone. Once very slow out of his crouch, Huff is now exiting it early when he needs to throw to a base, often before the pitch reaches him. He's struggled with throwing accuracy, but his pop times routinely hover around the 2.00 second mark, which is average. 
Huff has had some lower body injuries. A hamstring issue shelved him early in 2021 and he needed a surgery to remove free-floating bodies in his right knee later in the year, otherwise he would have lost rookie eligibility in 2021 instead of this year. That's the knee he catches on and that bears the biggest load as he moves around. Based on his size and injury track record, clubs think there's a greater chance relative to the baseline that Huff ends up playing mostly 1B/DH during the latter portion of his tenure. Huff has enough power to play some kind of bat-only role if that becomes the case because he has titanic, all-fields raw power. Minimalistic footwork in the box allows him to stay on time and damage pitches in the bottom third of the strike zone. He has some slider chase issues, but pitchers are playing with fire by approaching him that way because anything that doesn't finish below the zone might get tagged. There is worse-than-average upper-third, in-zone swing-and-miss happening here, and Huff is going to have a below-average hit tool. This would probably push him toward the bottom of the 1B/DH group of hitters if he ends up there, but sharing time with Jonah Heim (who was also a 45 FV prospect) will lighten the load on his legs, and also means that Huff can catch batterymates who work in such a way that they mask his deficiencies. To say he's just going to be a backup catcher isn't quite right, as Huff's power will dictate that he's in the lineup more often than that, and he and Heim are poised to produce like a star-level catcher in the aggregate.",,"22209"

The Yankees held fast to starting Otto and sent the then-25-year-old back to Double-A in 2021, where he was as dominant as any pitcher in the minors (103 strikeouts vs. 14 walks in 65 innings) before a promotion to Triple-A, and eventual trade to Texas as part of the Joey Gallo deal. Otto made his big league debut last year and has continued to start, eclipsing rookie thresholds this season. He's added a sinker in 2022 and now has five pitches, the best of which is his low-80s sweeping slider. Curiously, the velocity of Otto's curveball and slider overlap almost completely and only their shape (and if you can see the catcher's signs or Otto's grip on tape) differentiate the two. While Otto's command is not precise enough to make his stuff play above its raw grades, it is good enough for him to be considered a starter, and he certainly has a deep enough repertoire. Plus, he is now several years removed from his last injury and even further removed from his most severe one.

He's a power pitcher, with a sinking fastball that touches 98 mph, a tight and short slider, a split that tickles the 90s, and a 12-6 hook in the low-to-mid 80s. His offspeed is more good than great: While he doesn't have a reliable bat-missing secondary just yet, all three flash average and he has some feel for sequencing, particularly in pairing his heater and curve.
Between the end of 2019 and spring training last year, Frías cleaned up his delivery. It's still a little funky, with an unusual slow-fast-slow cadence as he starts his motion, lifts his leg, and drives toward the plate, but he's much more under control now and he threw plenty of strikes at Double-A. The big knock here is his movement profile. Frías works with a four-seamer out of an over-the-top slot, but his spin rate is well below average on that and all of his secondaries, so he probably won't miss as many bats as the velo suggests. That likely pushes him to relief in the end, where his heater should crest triple digits and he'll only need one of his offspeed pitches to tick up to project as a late-inning arm. There's also a modest chance he becomes a poor-man's Sandy Alcantara, where the stuff is too good to homer against consistently and he contributes as a grounder-generating innings eater.","zxleCAlKeXc","21997"

He has experience playing defense all over the field, seeing time mostly at shortstop, though he spent at least a little bit of time everywhere but first base and catcher in 2021. He continued to get run at a variety of positions during big league spring training but has only played short at Charlotte in the week and a half prior to publication. 
Gonzalez is a physical guy who's a little bit stiff, but he is rangy with a strong, if sometimes erratic arm. Even if his actions aren't slick and sexy, Romy does some stuff on defense that makes you think he can actually pass at shortstop, though he made 19 errors in 80 games there, which would easily lead the majors if you prorated that to a full season; Bo Bichette actually led  in errors in 2021 with 24. I know we're talking about errors, but that's a big gap. He has had some throwing accuracy issues early on in Triple-A this year. Gonzalez's feel for infield defense is much more polished than what he shows you in the outfield, though his speed under way and effort level make up somewhat for his lack of feel. It's important that he find a way to play multiple positions since it's a much more likely avenue for him to impact a big league club, as his hit tool issues will make it tough for him to play every day. 
Gonzalez's carrying tool is his above-average raw power, but he has a huge hole on the inner half and swings through middle-middle and middle-in pitches with alarming frequency. Leave something up and away from him, though, and he'll punish you. He has the strength to get extended on pitches on the outer third and do damage the other way. Big league pitchers are going to attack him with inner half velocity and dare him to catch it, and Romy may not be able to. As long as he's playing some shortstop, it's perfectly fine for him to end up being a 30 bat provided he's getting to some of that power and helping enable managerial creativity through his versatility.",,"21562"

His fastball's shallow approach angle gives it bat-missing utility at the top of the zone and he knows how to use it to set up his sweeping slider. He'll also occasionally create bat-missing action on his changeup, and can dump in a slower curveball early in the count to try to get ahead of hitters, though this pitch is hittable when it catches too much of the zone. From a body and pitch shape standpoint, José Urquidy is a good comp, though Urquidy's changeup is at least a full grade better than Brieske's is right now.

During this stretch, we had Heasley evaluated as a fastball/changeup reliever because his mid-70s curveball, despite it's plus raw spin, was easy to identify out of his hand and played like a below-average pitch, leaving him with two viable offerings. Fresh in 2022 has been a harder, mid-80s slider (he hasn't scrapped the curve, it's just become Heasley's fourth pitch) that flashes plus. For how new the pitch is, Heasley has impressive feel for locating it, though it has a tendency to back up as he fatigues later in outings.

After the Reds left Ashcraft to train remotely throughout 2020, he posted a 3.00 ERA and 129-to-37 strikeout-to-walk ratio across 22 starts, averaging about five innings per outing. Why the stubborn relief projection then? Ashcraft's build and grip-it-and-rip-it delivery are atypical for a starter, he's had a couple of hip surgeries, and his fastball and slider constitute about 97% of his pitch usage. Both of those pitches — a naturally cutting (and sinking — it's kind of weird) mid-90s fastball and a two-planed, mid-80s slider — are very good, and fit in the back of a bullpen should Ashcraft move there. He came out sitting 95-97 mph in early 2022 spring outings. This is Ashcraft's 40-man evaluation year and he'll likely be added after the season, then make his big league debut in 2023. If he can throw quality strikes with his fastball instead of being loose in the zone, and if a third, distinct pitch comes to the fore, we'll be inclined to start projecting him in a rotation.

Again, we see a pitcher whose fastball shape — in Pallante's case, some with natural cut and some with two-seam sink — makes it so it doesn't miss bats even though Pallante throws very hard. He complements the heat with a short, more explicit (as in, obvious) mid-80s cutter/slider, and a very explicit (as in, profane) upper-70s 12-to-6 curveball. It's a weird collection of pitches that generates a heavy dose of groundballs. From a statistical standpoint, Pallante looks like a lock to start: he's done nothing but throw strikes as an amateur and pro prospect, and sustains his velocity deep into games. Visually, his delivery looks unlike that of any starter in baseball, almost more like a tennis serve than a pitcher's mechanics, with some violence about the head and neck. Given how thin St. Louis' rotation feels due to Jack Flaherty's stubborn injury issues, it's more likely Pallante gets continued run in the Cardinals rotation for now (he graduated from rookie eligibility earlier this year). It might be ideal for him to be a multi-inning relief weapon who can come in and throw water on a would-be rally by getting a key groundball, then work another frame from start to finish.

He only began catching in a normal game environment during the fall of 2021, both at instructs and during Fall League, the latter being an absurd assignment for someone new to the position. Bride handled it with aplomb and is likely to improve into a viable big league catcher.

He has tended to live in the zone with his sinking fastball but isn't commanding it with precision. The cutter and Elder's newly heavy use of it will help keep hitters off his sinker, but its shape and pedestrian velocity make it a comfortably below-average pitch. Elder's changeup still has room for growth if he can learn to locate it more consistently. There are times when it looks like his nastiest pitch, but too many of them are still finishing in the heart of the strike zone.

Marinaccio is extremely likely to factor in the Yankees' 2022 bullpen as a bulk middle-inning reliever, and his stuff quality portends a bigger future role. Even with the velocity bump, his best pitch is still his trapdoor-action changeup, which sits mostly in the 80-84 mph range. His command is only fair, but Marinaccio's changeup has so much movement that it still elicits whiffs when he doesn't locate it well. His slider and tailing fastball, which have divergent movement, are more reliant on location and deception. Indeed, righty batters look very uncomfortable in the box against Marinaccio, who has a loose, quick arm stroke and low-ish slot.

He tracks pitches well and is willing to let pitch location dictate whether he pulls the ball or stays through it to center and right, deriving his power from natural strength rather than swinging with wild effort. The high-waisted Lopez has a wide range of athletic/mobility outcomes that will impact where he ultimately ends up on defense. He is much more likely to wind up on the fringes of 3B/1B than he is to see middle infield time at maturity. That puts pressure on his plate discipline to improve, since right now Lopez is a little too proactive at the plate and might be exposed at the upper levels. If he moves to first base, this will become especially scary. For now, he's lithe enough for third, where he has a pretty good shot to to be an everyday player based on the hit/power combo alone. Note that Lopez's 40-man/Rule-5 roster evaluation year is 2022, and that Pittsburgh's farm system depth, plus their openness to Rule-5 exposure for prospects a great distance from the majors makes him relatively unlikely to be added a year from now, unless he really blows the doors off of High-A.

Good health may have contributed to the breakout as much as anything else, as Pinto spent chunks of time on the IL earlier in his minor league career.

He hung around the honorable mention section of the Yankees prospect lists for several years before falling off after three seasons of well below-average offensive output at the level to which he was assigned. During that time, though, he was making an awful lot of contact, typically running strikeout rates close to 10%. Despite that impressive stat and Castillo's ability to (mostly) play a viable second base, he was passed over in the last two Rule 5 drafts. Then he had something of a 2021 breakout, hitting 11 homers (more than he had totaled in his entire career entering the season) in 58 games before the Yankees dealt him to Pittsburgh as part of the Clay Holmes trade. A few analytically-minded team personnel advocated for Castillo's inclusion in our in-season updates to the Top 100 because he has elite in-zone contact rates, hits the ball in the air a lot, plays the middle infield, and has performed on paper at the upper levels. 
The visual evaluation is still that of a skills-over-tools guy without the kind of explosion and athleticism that actually merits that kind of FV, but there are statistical indicators that suggest Castillo is different than he was when teams were passing on him in the Rule 5. His pull rate is up, his groundball rate is down, and Castillo's swing is naturally well-positioned for the current hitter/pitcher metagame, featuring lots of action toward the top of the strike zone. You can limit the damage he does toward the bottom of the zone. Castillo is a mixed bag on defense, capable of making routine plays all over the infield but lacking in spectacular range and athleticism. He might end up fitting best at third base but he'd be more valuable playing a lot of shift-aided second base — a Keystone Light, if you will. He's at least a 1 WAR role-player, though the feel for contact gives him a shot to break better than that.",,"19906"

Serven has seen something like 50% sliders in 2022 as opponents try to get the free-swinging Sun Devil to chase, but instead his walk rate exploded in his second taste of Triple-A. His swing path is best suited for clubbing pitches down and away from him, and he's banged the sliders that don't finish. He has average pull-power, but that's really the only area he does big damage. It might actually be enough for Serven to be Colorado's catcher of the immediate future if his approach changes are real. He's made some strides on defense, as well. While Serven was at ASU, he struggled badly with ball-blocking, and at times it seemed like he was so beat up that he couldn't move to block one more pitch in the dirt from the poorly-developed ASU arms. He operates out of a high crouch and looks more mobile now, though he still gives up some long rebounds. Serven's arm plays down due to a long exchange, but he's a great pitch framer (at least, to the naked eye), especially at the bottom of the strike zone, where Serven's strong hands operate like they're filled with helium.

After he signed, he was used pretty conservatively in a bullpen role for workload/health reasons, then was sent straight to Triple-A in 2021, where he struggled some with walks. That continued in a more stark, concerning way during his 2021 Fall League run, when Thompson was throwing about as hard as he ever has, but walked nearly a batter per inning. The Cardinals changed his position on the rubber in 2022 and this simple tweak may have remedied things. While Thompson began the year starting at Memphis, he's made his big league debut deployed mostly in long relief outings. The headline pitch here is Thompson's picturesque curveball, a deadly, mid-70s parabola much like Liberatore's. Like Libby, Thompson's fastball traits don't fit perfectly with it, and the curveball pops out of his hand in a noticeable way, which impacts hitters' propensity to chase it. It limits his curveball's utility, but it's a great in-zone offering he can use to get ahead of hitters and generate groundballs. Still sitting 93-94 mph, his fastball can get swings and misses up and to the arm side of the plate. There's a new-ish cutter/slider here, too, and it's interesting that even though Thompson has elite curveball spin rates, it hasn't translated to the spin on the cutter/slider at all. He's barely thrown the pitch in the big leagues even though it was operating at a 14% clip at Memphis; it looks below-average to the eye. There's no dominant swing-and-miss offering here, no matter how pretty Thompson's curveball might be. Assuming the recent strike throwing rebound holds, Thompson still projects to be a lower-impact rotation piece with a shot to pop better than that if his feel for spin can be parlayed into a second good breaking ball down the line.",,"25918"

Alexy holds 93-95 mph as a starter, peaking in the 96-98 range. He's sustained that while remaining pretty healthy throughout his pro career save for the 2019 season (lat strain), racking up about 20 appearances (all but a few of them starts) during every other minor league season since '17. Alexy underwent a mechanical change similar to the one Lucas Giolito made and now has a much shorter arm action than he did a few years ago, but this hasn't resulted in finer control, and Alexy is a stuff-reliant in-zone bully at best. His fastball is more about arm strength and angle than movement (and it missed fewer bats than we'd have guessed during Alexy's 2021 cup of coffee), and pairs nicely with his 12-to-6 upper-70s curveball, which he de-emphasized last season. Instead, Alexy used his mid-80s slider and changeup each about 18% of the time in 2021, though his changeup usage has been down considerably at Triple-A in deference to his curve. Whether this shift has been driven by a short-term developmental focus or will be Alexy's new approach to pitching in the big leagues isn't clear. His pronation-style changeup has developed a lot and has become Alexy's finishing pitch against lefty hitters, so it's likely going to be a big part of how he gets outs in whatever role he ends up in, be it a walk-prone, inefficient starter or a four-to-six out weapon.","ekkMVb-yMKc","22343"

Massey is not only in that bucket, but he was also dealing with a back issue that impacted his performance in 2019. Sent to High-A in 2021, he had a huge season, slashing .289/.351/.531 with 50 extra-base hits (21 of them homers) and an impressive 15% K%. Of course, he was a 23-year-old college hitter crushing A-ball pitching, albeit one who hadn't been healthy and active for two years. Not all of the visual and underlying statistical evidence corroborates Massey's 2021 line. While he has some hitterish elements (the short-levered Massey is adept at catching fastballs on the inner third), his swing is relatively grooved, he tends to be vulnerable to back-foot breaking balls, and he's a fairly aggressive swinger. His peak exit velocities aren't what you'd expect from someone who just hit 20 bombs, resting comfortably below average, and the same is true of his barrel rate. His swing is so geared for lift, however, that even if he doesn't have big raw, Massey seems likely to hit for in-game power by virtue of how often he hits the ball in the air. Massey has only ever played second base in pro ball and he probably needs to start branching out to other positions since he doesn't quite have the hit/power combination to project as an everyday second baseman. He's not a candidate to try to move up the defensive spectrum, especially not in an org that is loaded at shortstop ahead of him. Instead, we'll be looking for him to get some reps at third base and the outfield corners en route to a lefty-hitting utility role. ",,"27684"

None of those pitches are particularly dazzling, but he creates deception with the pace of his delivery and a short arm action that catches hitters off guard. His reputation as a strike-thrower who attacks the zone but lacks stellar secondaries preceded him when he made his major league debut, with opposing batters swinging early and punishing him for occasional lapses in command that he was more easily able to get away with in the minors. Overall, though, Crawford's command improved across the board in 2021, which in turn improved his odds of weaponizing a good-not-great pitch mix.

He will give a big league team a good at-bat off the bench and an upgrade on the bases, and he can competently spell or sub for any of your heavy-hitting, shift-enabled infielders later in games. Hernandez has the fourth-lowest swinging strike rate in the minor leagues since 2019.

He struggled to stay healthy early in his career and didn't slug over .400 at any level until 2019, when he broke camp in the Midwest League for the third straight year. The home runs finally began to pile up in 2021, when Yepez suddenly hit 27 combined between Double-A Springfield and Triple-A Memphis, mostly at the latter. He then went to the Arizona Fall League, where he faced pitchers who were worse on the average than those he had seen throughout the regular season. He homered seven more times in just 23 games in Arizona, creating some perhaps overzealous buzz. While Yepez easily has plus power, the track record for 1B/DH-only types who strike out as much as he does, especially for the swing-happy reasons he has tended to, isn't great. Yepez had walked at a 5-6% clip in the low-to-mid minors, but showed a year-over-year increase in 2019 (9% in a 72-game sample) and ’21 (12% in 134 games, including the AFL), and he's has presented some visual evidence that he’s refined his approach (he’s ditching his leg kick with two strikes). 
Now in the big leagues (enough that he graduated from rookie status prior to list pub), Yepez has tended to expand the zone. So far in 2022, his chase rates (38% O-Swing) are among the top 25 chasiest in baseball (the big league average is 32%). While all of that is true, his power is huge and Yepez's feel for contact is actually quite good; when he's swinging at strikes, he tends to find a way to put the bat on the ball and pull it with power. In addition to developing an actual two-strike approach, Yepez has also slimmed way down even just since the 2021 Fall League, and he's learning at the wing of Albert Pujols as a big league rookie. These are all reasons for Cardinals fans to hope I'm going to end up being light on Yepez's projection, and indeed, if he gets regular at-bats, it won't surprise me if Yepez has several 25-plus homer seasons. But at the 1B/DH end of the defensive spectrum (Yepez has mostly played the outfield corner in the big leagues and hasn't been good), even amid a big peak year or two, players like this tend to perform close to the 1 annual WAR range as part-time corner role players or low-end options at their position, like Christian Walker, Michael Chavis, and Ryon Healy. Yepez has better tactile feel to hit than those guys, and maybe the more precise comp is Franmil Reyes. This is a dangerous hitter who I think has a place in a good big league lineup (like the current Cardinals lineup), but I have to factor the approach-related bust risk (and year-to-year volatility) into Yepez's grade, since that specific trait tends to create highly variable year-to-year performance."," ","18400"

The rest of his repertoire is unusually hard. His best secondary pitch is a mid-80s changeup, which sometimes has cut action that can make it look like a slider; that may have caused it to be misclassified by some clubs’ automatic pitch tagging algorithms, which show him as having a “low-spin slider.” Some of Oller’s best pitches are these cutting changeups. Oller does have a cutter/slider type of pitch that’s also in the mid-80s and has short, lateral movement. But his shapely curveball, which is also in the low-to-mid 80s area, is the better of his two breaking balls. The overlapping velocity of all these secondary pitches likely contributed to what I think is some misclassification. Watching the catcher’s signs and Oller’s grip on video reinforce this.

His curveball has plus-plus spin rates but is easy to identify out of his hand since he has a sink/tail-oriented fastball.

His walk rate nearly doubled, he saw about 3.8 pitches per plate appearance during the year, and his 46% Swing% combined at Triple-A and while with Estrellas in the Dominican Winter League is close to the big league average. While many of Colorado's affiliates are hitter-friendly, Hartford, where Montero spent most of 2021, plays closer to neutral. If this is a real, sustained development, then Montero is going to be a valuable big league hitter very soon. His swing is simple but he still has the strength to do damage (this guy's going to hit 40 annual doubles at Coors) without an elaborate cut, he covers the whole plate, and while he's vulnerable to well-located breaking balls, he punishes the ones that don't quite finish. He's also held serve as a viable third baseman and has experience at first. We still have Montero projected as more of a second-division regular sort because the hit/power combination is more solid than exceptional, and because it's possible there will be a regression to his career mean in the plate discipline department.","Lpf6ltH3L2M","20543"

While Lambert doesn't have surgical control, he peppers the zone with his 92-94 mph fastball, he'll occasionally reach back for 96, and all of his secondary pitches are pretty good. His slider typically finishes on the glove-side of the plate (though it sometimes catches a lot of it) while his changeup finishes in its lower third, and his mid-70s spike curveball provides him with an occasional change of pace option. After having TJ in the middle of 2019 and enduring a 60-day IL stint toward the end of the '20 season, Lambert was healthy in '21 and made four spot starts throughout the year.

Feltner's slider has typical two-plane movement, but his mid-70s curveball is more of a loopy show-me pitch that may have diminishing returns the more opposing hitters see it. Those two breaking balls are deployed much more frequently than his changeup at this point. We've adjusted our role projection for Feltner a little bit and now consider him a multi-inning relief prospect. Inefficient strike-throwing starters tend to have nastier stuff than he does, and Feltner's curveball probably works best going just once through the lineup.

Two of those went for extra-bases, though it should be noted that his big league triple was on a 60 mph offering from Rays catcher Francisco Mejía, who was eating innings on the mound during blowout. Much more impressive was Wong's double off of Shohei Ohtani, which banged off the right field wall. In fact, all three of his hits to come against actual big league pitching went to the opposite field and came on pitches on the outer half of the plate, an area of the zone where he had at times seemed vulnerable while in the lower levels of the minors. But he has steadily improved against offerings there, employing a slap-hitting approach and spraying peripheral pitches to right. That said, his ability to adjust his barrel to pitches at various locations has made for a swing-happy approach; in his tiny sample of big league at-bats, Wong struck out 50% of the time. He didn't strike out quite that much at Triple-A, though a 27.9% K rate isn't exactly stellar, especially when paired with a walk rate below 5%.

He made his big league debut with the Padres as a 21-year-old who had jumped right from Low-A to the majors but didn't really stick the landing, hit just .182, then was sent down to Triple-A, where he performed at a league-average level before being traded to Pittsburgh as part of the Adam Frazier deal. Per a scout, Marcano ""looked like he was trying to take a drink from a fire hose"" in 2021, perhaps put in a compromising developmental position by some combination of the roster rules that force teams to make 40-man decisions on Latin American players too soon and (in this instance, anyway) an overzealous approach by the Padres. His ceiling capped by a total lack of physicality, Marcano was a skills-over-tools sort with great feel for contact. He often stood out among his same-aged peers for his level of advancement and instincts, but the speed of the game at Triple-A and above was understandably too much for him. The Padres had him playing all over the infield and then added both corner outfield positions to his duties in 2021, and Marcano seemed to regress as a defender everywhere once his time was divided among five positions. His narrow frame has never supported any kind of real power projection. Instead, Marcano looks like a low-end bench infielder",,"22871"

The Diamondbacks claimed him off of waivers from the Guardians after the season, and he figures to get an up/down relief opportunity with the Snakes in 2022; he could stick in Phoenix with a bounce back. Nelson hides the ball really well, typically goes right at hitters, his fastball once had very high spin for a pitch at its velocity, and he has a nasty, downward-breaking slider that he throws about half the time. He also developed an upper-80s cutter that, at least as far as our looks are concerned, is relatively new.",,"20515"

An infielder at Wake Tech Community College, the thin right-hander decided to give pitching a shot in Legion ball after his freshman year. He threw well enough from there to earn a walk-on invite to UNC-Wilmington, where he refined his two-plane slider and landed on LA's radar as a senior sign in 2018. Three years later, Warren emerged as one of the few reliable arms in Joe Maddon's bullpen down the stretch. Stuff-wise, he's a 94-and-a-slider type, perhaps providing fewer strikeouts and generating more grounders than most guys with this profile. His big league walk rate is perhaps likely to regress to something more resembling his minor league career rates, which aren't great. If he can split the difference, he'll be a good reliever.",,"24937"

In the intervening years, Herrera has mostly been hurt, averaging about 40 games per season during the first five years of his career. In the two most recent years in which there has been baseball, he has combined to post an OBP just north of .370 while catching exclusively. He's caught about 75 games each of his last two full seasons and has begun to take game reps at first base in the 2021-22 Venezuelan Winter League. Herrera is a short-levered switch-hitter who is tough to get to swing and miss. He sprays singles and doubles contact to all fields, and while he won't hit for any power, he's a fine defensive backstop (superior to Daulton Varsho and Cooper Hummel) with two above-average offensive skills, and is thus a viable 40-man catcher.",,"17040"

His velocity began to climb in 2019 and Yajure was touching some 97s as he ascended to the upper levels of the minors with the Yankees. In 2020, he sat 90-94 mph during his big league outings with New York while spending the rest of the year at the alternate site. Sent to Pittsburgh as part of the Jameson Taillon trade, Yajure's velocity was down about two ticks in 2021 as he sat more 90-91 and was shut down for a couple of months with a forearm strain. He was still sitting about 91 when he returned and got touched up in a small big league sample. He continued to throw a high rate of strikes at Triple-A and now has six pitches if you make a distinction between Yajure's four- and two-seamer. His changeup seemed to lose some of its arm-side action in 2021 and his delivery's pace and timing was more variable, but Yajure goes at hitters with the kitchen sink and seems likely to graduate this year. He looks more like a No. 4/5 starter with his current velocity after falling toward the back of the 50 FV tier when he was throwing harder.",,"21111"

Challenged with an assignment to Triple-A to enter the 2021 season, he excelled in short stints and ended the year with 10 scoreless appearances with the major league club. Nearly as wide as he is tall, Castro leans heavily on a two-pitch mix, with his bread and butter being a mid-90s fastball that can touch 98 mph and plays even better than the velocity thanks to vertical shape and rising action. He has a weird low-80s curve that features solid depth despite low-spin rates, but the pitch is highly inconsistent, flashing both plus and fringy. Unlike many ex-catchers on the mound, Castro has an easy arm action and repeats his delivery well. But while his control is solid, his command can be a bit spotty at times. He'll likely break camp in the big leagues, and should have a long career as a seventh/eighth inning type.",,"21656"

His slider and changeup are both closer to average, and the absence of a plus secondary puts Morets in more of an up/down relief bucket than an integral role.

Nevin's terrific feel to hit led to lots of aesthetically-pleasing doubles contact while he was a Rockie, but the game power it generated was insufficient as Nevin trended down the defensive spectrum into the 1B/LF area due to arm strength and accuracy issues. A fresh start with Baltimore increased the possibility of a shift in Nevin's approach and while his swing doesn't have overt differences compared to the 2019 version, his batted ball output was more air-oriented in '21 than ever before. He set a career-high in homers (16) with Norfolk, but all the fly balls helped tank his BABIP and he slashed .227/.305/.392 as a 24-year-old. Nevin's feel to hit is still good, his swing is balanced and deft, he makes contact all over the zone and he's especially adept at opening his hips and ambushing pitches on the middle third. He lacks the power typical of a player fit for a part-time corner role but he hits enough to project into a low-end version of that role for a while, and he's a candidate for eventual transition to a foreign pro league.",,"17893"
