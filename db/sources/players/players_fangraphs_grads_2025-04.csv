1,1,"James Wood","WSN","CF","MLB",2024,"65","High",,"22.0388888","6' 7""","240","L","L",2021,"Draft","SDP",2600000,"IMG Academy","Wood is one of only a couple minor leaguers with such immense physical potential that they have a realistic shot to be an elite, perhaps generational player, or at least a player of singular ability. Like Elly De La Cruz and Oneil Cruz before him, Wood has issues that threaten to undermine his profile, but he's so overtly gifted that he's one of only a few prospects with a realistic shot at being a 70-grade player or better on tools. 
Wood was a divisive amateur prospect, with some scouts seeing him as a center fielder with elite raw power projection and others seeing him as an eventual first baseman with hit tool risk. He was unbelievable out of the gate as a Padres prospect; he only struck out 17.8% of the time at Lake Elsinore and hit .337/.453/.601 before the Padres traded him to Washington as part of the Juan Soto blockbuster, after which he hit .293/.366/.463. He did this amid multiple wrist injuries, which is something to keep in the back of our collective mind in the event that it becomes a chronic issue, as Wood's wrists are an integral part of keeping his swing short enough to be manageable. Hit tool cracks were more evident in 2023, as Wood struck out in 32% of his PAs and was especially flummoxed by changeups, but he still managed to hit .262/.353/.520 with 62 extra-base hits. Early in 2024, he's cut his strikeout rate back down into the teens during an epic April and May at Rochester.
Because of how long-levered Wood is, it's likely he'll always strike out a lot, but he's surprisingly dangerous on the inner third of the plate for a guy with his build. He's shown flashes of covering high-and-away fastballs with power, as well as an ability to alter his posture to spoil soft stuff away from him, but he does neither of these consistently right now and those are the ways in which he's most vulnerable to whiffs. Once his wrist and forearms get stronger, he might be able to be a little shorter to the ball without sacrificing power, and early in 2024 it looks as though exactly this is happening. 
Wood is also surprisingly agile on defense. He takes a little while to get his legs churning, but once he's moving, he's a plus runner and has generated some home-to-first times in the neighborhood of 4.1-4.2 seconds. His huge strides enable him to cover a ton of ground in center field, and it's incredible that he not only has a chance to play there, but could be quite good for at least a little while. Wood looks super smooth going into the gaps and approaching the wall. His poise and feel for center are both currently superior to Dylan Crews', but it's much more typical for a compact athlete like Crews to stay up the middle for the long haul. Wood currently carries 240 pounds like a young Marcedes Lewis and is likely going to add weight commensurate with his frame as he matures, which might mean 30 pounds or more. The way that shakes out will have a significant impact on his defensive future. That said, Wood is already defying convention by looking as good as he does out there at his current size. In a lot of ways, Wood's report reads like a young Adam Dunn's, though we'd expect Wood to play better defense even if he ends up in an outfield corner. Admittedly a less stable hitter than a lot of the other elite prospects in baseball, Wood's ceiling is on another planet.","b32UDJr1jmk","29518"
1,1,"Jackson Holliday","BAL","2B","MLB",2025,"65","Med",,"20.825","6' 0""","185","L","R",2022,"Draft","BAL",8190000,"Stillwater HS (OK)","This is the fifth coat of paint applied to Holliday's scouting report in the last couple of months. Jackson was shot out of a cannon in his first full pro season and slashed .323/.442/.499 across four levels, ending the season with Triple-A Norfolk at age 19. Despite being three to five years younger than the typical player at High- and Double-A, Holliday had 101 walks, 51 extra-base hits, and 24 stolen bases in '23 Again, this was a teenage shortstop's first full professional season. Now 20, Holliday and the entire Norfolk lineup began the 2024 season on a collective tear while the Orioles were getting little production from second base. Holliday was promoted, hit .059 during a two-week big league trial, and was sent back down. It was the first hiccup he has experienced as a pro, maybe ever. He only sort of bounced back after the demotion, slashing .252/.418/.429 in the time between when he was sent back to Norfolk and when he was put on the IL with elbow inflammation in mid-June. Holliday DH'd for the first couple of weeks upon return from the IL and had just begun playing playing defense again in late-July. 
In a way, the IL stint is comforting because it offered a potential explanation for why Holliday's performance and ferocious bat speed had tapered off a bit. Holliday’s spray chart shifted away from his pull side and moved toward left field and the third base line in the weeks leading up to his shelving. He was inside-outing lots of contact the opposite way, including pitches on the inner third of the plate that he typically turns on, and it was taking what appeared to be an uncomfortable and excessive amount of effort for him to swing hard. We do not think there is any reason for panic here though it's worth acknowledging that Holliday basically hasn't looked good for the window spanning his big league call up to the start of August.
Jackson is unbelievably talented in terms of his plate discipline, coordination, and in-the-box athleticism, and it's amazing that he reached the big leagues at age 20. He has a big, slow leg kick, takes a huge stride forward, and has loose and explosive hips and hands that helped him post a 45% hard-hit rate last season (neck and neck with Wyatt Langford, even though Jackson is a couple years younger). Even though Holliday's stride can sometimes pull him off toward first base, he finds ways to get his arms extended to cover the outer edge of the plate anyway. He's a very special young hitter, though there are a couple of nits worth picking; it is the very top of the prospect list after all. Holliday struggled to pull fastballs in 2023 and slugged less than .400 against them, per Synergy. Holliday's measurable power is, in most respects, pretty comfortably below the big league average at the moment even though he just got done slugging .490 last year and is slugging .470 at Norfolk right now. 
He also isn't currently a big league-quality shortstop defender and definitely isn't better than Gunnar Henderson, though his elbow injury might have something to do with that. Healthy Holliday's ability to make accurate throws from odd platforms is impressive, as is his poise and internal clock. He’s most comfortable throwing on the move and often goes out of his way to do so even when it isn't called for. Holliday lets a lot of choppers take an unnecessarily high hop, with the direction of that hop sometimes surprising him. He needs to do a better job of staying low and attacking this type of ball in play closer to the ground. We've altered his defensive projection to second base because it's where Holliday is most likely to play with Gunnar around. It's typical for players Holliday's age to need to make some adjustments and it appears that's what a hopefully healthy Holliday will spend the rest of 2024 doing. He has all of the scout-y athletic traits that indicate most of where he currently falls short will improve as his body matures. It might take a year longer than Orioles fans want it to, but Holliday is very likely to become a 5-WAR middle infielder who does everything well.","kLSYztort4s","31781"
2,1,"Wyatt Langford","TEX","LF","MLB",2024,"65","Med",,"22.8777777","6' 1""","225","R","R",2023,"Draft","TEX",8000000,"Florida","Langford graduated as the no. 2 prospect in baseball. Despite his slow-ish start to the regular season, I wasn't inclined to move him down, or to move Paul Skenes or James Wood (who have the same FV grade as Langford) ahead of him. This guy's ability to clean out velocity around his hands is on a different level than all but a few big league hitters, and the fact that he was in the big leagues after playing a little over a month of minor league games is incredible. I'm not especially worried that his rookie season, which was interrupted by a May IL stint for hamstring tightness, has been middling so far. Here is his report from the offseason: Langford slugged an incredible .719 as a sophomore at Florida, a remarkable feat considering he barely played the season before. Then he slashed .373/.498/.784 as a junior and solidified himself as a top-three talent in a loaded draft. After he signed, Langford lit pro ball on fire for the better part of two months, slashing a combined .360/.480/.677 as he climbed all the way to Triple-A. During that 200 PA span, Langford's underlying TrackMan data was so good that you could use it to spearhead an argument that he should be first on the overall prospect list, with plus measurable power and plate discipline, as well as an 81% contact rate. If you buy that Langford is actually that good, then he's perhaps the most complete hitter in the minors. 
It's rare for hitters to hit the ball both as often as Langford has and as hard as he does, even among big leaguers. Buff and twitchy, the short-levered Langford's arms are nearly as thick as they are long; Mike Trout is a fair body comp. His compact swing allows it to enter the hitting zone very quickly, enabling him to stay short to the ball and crush letter-high pitches, which is how he does most of his extra-base damage. Langford is apt to swing inside pitches on the outer third of the plate, perhaps because his levers are so short and he can't reach out there, and also because he's a bit of a bucket strider whose style of swinging is pretty common around baseball (Davis Schneider and a bunch of other Blue Jays swing like this, Henry Davis too). Langford's lower half is quite flexible and strong, and so are his hands. He has titanic power and is much better than a lot of the other top prospects at turning on velocity. 
Langford is also incredibly fast for a player his size, and some of his home-to-first times are a 70 on the scouting scale. Even though he has the speed for center and has played there a little bit, his feel for the position (and for playing outfield defense in general) is very poor. He's simply not comfortable out there, but his pure speed gives him a shot to be an impact defender if he can find his footing over time. Langford is a much more dangerous hitter than Jackson Holliday is right now. His power is fully actualized and he's much more likely to play an impact big league role from the jump than Holliday is, especially if the Rangers just DH Langford. Risk that this might happen anyway, especially with Leody Taveras and Evan Carter both around, is why Langford slots in as prospect no. 2 overall.",,"33333"
4,1,"Paul Skenes","PIT","SP","MLB",2024,"65","Med",,"22.3388888","6' 6""","235","R","R",2023,"Draft","PIT",9200000,"LSU","Skenes is a ready-made, front-of-the-rotation starter who has yet to experience any kind of a speed bump in pro ball. He entered the season as the best pitching prospect in the sport and has only gotten better. His new splitter/sinker and increased changeup usage and feel are meaningful developments, and put him in rarified air for a pitching prospect. He is one of only five pitchers who has ever been given an FV grade this high at FanGraphs and he has done nothing but reinforce that grade as he dominates big league opponents. A Herculean physical presence with even bigger stuff, he is perhaps the most important part of an increasingly promising situation in Pittsburgh, a city whose baseball team has made three playoff appearances over the last 30 years. 
Almost exactly two years ago, Skenes was still a two-way player at Air Force. His velocity climbed throughout that season, and at its conclusion a decision loomed as to whether he’d return to the Air Force Academy for a third year and effectively be locked into a two-year service commitment, or use the relatively new transfer portal rules to facilitate a one-year launching pad to pro baseball at a bigger program. Skenes transferred to LSU and was a member of the 2023 College World Series champions, a veritable All-Star team with several high-profile transfers, the closest thing college baseball has had to a Fab Five of its own. Though he was a first round prospect at Air Force, Skenes’ stuff, consistency, and physicality all took a leap at LSU. He ascended toward the very top of draft boards and was a justifiable first overall pick. His stuff was good enough for him to immediately compete with, if not overwhelm, major leaguers, but the Pirates gave Skenes some very specific developmental boxes to check before he was promoted. Namely, Skenes made his first ever start on four days’ rest (college starters pitch once a week). He debuted less than a year after he was drafted, at age 21.
All of this happened very quickly, and Skenes has been evolving and progressing the entire time. His velocity has been creeping north pretty consistently for the past two years, even now. His 2024 average fastball velocity (99 mph, peaking at 102) is up a tad compared to 2023. He tends to use his fastball as a finishing pitch and more evenly mixes in his panoply of secondary stuff early in counts. So far Skenes has paired this fastball most often with a hard slider. This was pretty comfortably his go-to secondary pitch in college. He manipulates the shape and velocity of it depending on what he’s trying to execute. It can bend in around 83-86 mph and act as a strike-stealing curveball, or it can peak around 90-92 mph and look more like a cutter. Traditional sliders are sandwiched somewhere between those two other pitch types. Because Skenes delivers from a lower slot, there are times when he gets around the side of his slider too much, and the pitch lacks the two-plane break of an untouchable one, but hitters have to be so keyed up to hit his 99-100 mph fastballs that they often whiff at those lesser sliders anyway. It’s maybe a plus pitch purely on stuff, but the east/west interaction Skenes’ slider has with his fastball and his ability to sculpt the shape of his breaker to the situation will probably help it play up. 
We qualify Skenes’ slider as “his go-to secondary pitch in college” because his changeup usage has taken a leap in pro ball. Not only that, but Skenes has essentially developed a second changeup. He has a more traditionally gripped changeup from his amateur days, but he’s added a mid-90s “splinker” à la Jhoan Duran of the Twins and José Soriano of the Angels. It’s a modified two-seamer that uses something approaching a splitter grip. Skenes tends to pronate over the top of his traditional changeup. The baseball comes off his middle and ring fingers to create movement that bottoms out below the zone. This type of release actually imparts some spin on the baseball, so Skenes’ changeups tend to live in the low 90s at about 2,100 rpm, while his splinker sits more in the mid-90s, spins less (closer to 1,800 rpm), and has more tailing action toward the knees of right-handed hitters. The rate at which Skenes has learned some of these new tricks (including the way he changes position on the rubber depending on hitters’ handedness) is very exciting. This guy is better now than he was a year ago, when he was the first overall pick in the draft. He looks like one of the best handful of pitchers in the sport.",,"33677"
5,1,"Jackson Chourio","MIL","CF","MLB",2024,"65","Med",,"20.5555555","5' 11""","198","R","R",2021,"J2","MIL",1900000,"Venezuela","Chourio, who turns 20 in March, has been among the very best prospects in baseball for the better part of the past 18 months. He turned 19 just before the start of the 2023 season and slashed .280/.336/.467 in 122 games at Double-A Biloxi before the Brewers gave him a six-game shot of espresso at Triple-A Nashville in late September. His power, speed, and, more recently, his improvements on defense give him rare upside as a 30/30 threat and plus center field defender. During the offseason, Milwaukee signed Chourio to an eight-year (plus two options), $82 million contract that could earn Chourio as much as $140 million depending on whether those options are exercised. 
Chourio checks most of the boxes from a visual scouting standpoint. He’s a plus-plus runner (routinely 4.10 from home to first, at times a jailbreak 4.00 seconds flat) who has grown into being a great center field defender even though the former second baseman has only played there full-time for two seasons and change. He also has plus-plus bat speed and is capable of putting balls into the seats to all fields. The length of his swing might make it tough for Chourio to catch up to major league velocity up around his hands, and there’s a rigidity to the way his hands work that we don't love, which is where the little bit of hit tool risk comes from. But Chourio’s talent is so electrifying that even if he’s a flawed contact hitter, he’s still going to do enough other stuff at a high level to be a star player.
Plus, it’s encouraging that Chourio’s strikeout rate has improved since early in 2022, when he first began using this high-octane swing. It’s possible he’s just getting better feel for this relatively new style of swinging over time and that everything will be fine. He’s also developed a more dynamic approach during the last two seasons and is now cutting out his leg kick with two strikes. Because he’s already shown the aptitude to make adjustments like this, we can expect that he'll be able to shorten up his swing if it turns out he needs to. Again, whatever qualms we have with Chourio’s swing he makes up for with his bat speed (which enables him to smash fastballs he’s a bit late on toward the opposite field) and the power he generates on contact. The Baby Acuña comps are a little overzealous, as Chourio’s body and athletic style are both much more tightly wound than Ronald Acuña Jr.’s. Indeed, from a build and swing standpoint, Bo Bichette is a more apt comparison.","c5gspkixrs0","28806"

In his walk year with Orix, he produced two more WAR than the next best NPB pitcher (Roki Sasaki) even though Yamamoto threw 30 fewer innings (164) than he had in each of the last two seasons. He produced his third consecutive season with a sub-2.00 ERA, as well as a sterling 26.6% K%, 4.4% BB%, 53% GB%, a microscopic 1% HR/FB% and a career-best 1.74 FIP. A plus-plus on-mound athlete with mid-90s arm strength, Yamamoto locates virtually all of his pitches at will and walked just 28 batters across 164 innings in 2023. His mid-90s fastball (he averaged 95 mph but peaks in the 97-99 mph range) enjoys substantial in-zone whiff utility thanks to his velo, the rise/run shape and shallow angle of his heater, and Yamamoto's feel for locating it in the top third of the zone and above. After several consecutive seasons of decline, Yamamoto showed an uptick in two-seamer usage in 2023, though his groundball rate dropped four percentage points compared to prior years. His four-seamer pairs nicely with a nasty, old school, upper-70s curveball, which Yamamoto uses to both get ahead of and finish hitters. A low-90s splitter is his best pitch and most-deployed secondary weapon. It has exceptional bat-missing drop and doesn't need to be located precisely in order to play. A more pedestrian slider/cutter, which lives off of Yamamoto's consistent glove-side command, rounds out his repertoire. 
Inextricably linked to Japanese pitching prospects are questions about how they'll respond to a potential change in routine (a start once every five days instead of once a week) and how their breaking stuff will play upon transition to the lower-seamed MLB baseball. While these apply to Yamamoto, it's plausible an MLB team will parlay his combination of arm strength and feel for spin into a better hard slider, or variant thereof, so there is also some ""good variance"" around the way I'm projecting Yamamoto's breaking ball(s) here. The entire package is very reminiscent of peak Zack Greinke, as Yamamoto's frame, delivery, stuff quality and command are all of that ilk.","omgz7L7Sfw0","33825"

He was tasked with a move to center field in the wake of the Juan Soto/Trent Grisham trade and, despite having never played there before, took to it quickly. I updated my thoughts on his defense in April and Merrill returned to top 10 overall prospect status. He's had an incredible rookie season (as of the All-Star break, he's slashing .282/.315/.440 with 12 bombs and his expected stats are even better than that) and is easily going to set a single-season career high for homers. Merrill has one of the prettiest swings in baseball and it's feasible that the 21-year-old will come into more raw power as he matures. He's a special player who the Padres signed for an under-slot bonus. They supposedly had him ahead of Marcelo Mayer on their draft board that year and absolutely nailed it. This is a franchise center fielder (who knows, though, he might return to short one day) with a special bat. He's one of the best young hitters in the game.","-JmCUHgebC4","29490"

He mashed his way across five minor league levels in two years and reached the big leagues in 2023 just a couple months after his 20th birthday. In 2023, he slashed .324/.384/.591 over 36 games at High-A Bowling Green and 81 for Double-A Montgomery, striking out 19.6% of the time and drawing walks at a 8.2% clip on his way to 55 extra-base hits (31 bombs!) at just 19-years-old. He also got a taste of big league pitching, appearing in seven games for the Rays. This year, Caminero has been in Durham, where Baseball Savant has his expected statline pegged at .259/.332/.463. His strikeout rate (23% — Cami has tended to K in the 14-18% range as a pro) is slightly higher than we're accustomed to seeing from him, though that's to be expected given both some swing issues we're about to get into and that he's facing savvy Triple-A pitching as a 20-year-old. 
Caminero already has plus-plus bat speed and raw power, and swings with bloodthirsty effort. He hits out of a crouched, open stance, and utilizes a leg kick and rhythmic hand hitch as his timing triggers. He loads his hands super deep and high, which often causes him to be late into the hitting zone against fastballs, but his bat speed is so ridiculous that he's still able to torch deeper-travelling heaters to the opposite field with home run power (he hit a ball 117 mph this year). Caminero's cacophonous cut leaves him vulnerable to good velocity up around his hands, which is where he does a lot of his swinging and missing. His breaking ball recognition and overall plate discipline are both pretty crude, but his feel for contact has carried enough water to keep him from having any significant strikeout issues so far. 
Caminero began to transition from shortstop to third base in 2023, and candidly, he did not look good playing third in winter ball for Escogido during the offseason. We had him projected to right field off this look, but he looked better in 2024 before Caminero suffered a Grade 2 quad strain at the end of May (he hasn't yet returned as of this update). Caminero is somewhat limited in his lateral range and quick-twitch traits, but his hands and arm strength should allow him to be an average defender at the hot corner. His throwing accuracy can be a bit shaky at times, especially when throwing on the run, and obviously we want to see how mobile he is coming off of this injury, but we've altered his position projection compared to the offseason Top 100 list here. How the Rays handle his ultimate position might be influenced by Isaac Paredes' continued level of production at third. It's more likely Cami will get DH reps if the Rays deem him worthy of a big league roster spot. Regardless of his position, and though there might need to be some adjustments against inside fastballs, this guy has incredible offensive talent and is going to be a middle-of-the-order force.","jgEhA6bbNE8","28163"

As of this update, he has been in Arizona swinging a bat for about a week. Carter missed most of the 2021 campaign with the same injury. I have tended to be lower on Carter than the consensus because I don't think he has huge physical tools and I feel more comfortable with him playing defense in left field than center, but he has elite secondary skills that buoy his performance. He graduates forecast as an above-average everyday left fielder. Here is his report from the offseason Top 100: In the Randy Arozarena vein, you just don't want to overthink this one now that Carter has shown what he's capable of in the game's most intense moments. We stayed relatively low on Carter (he was one of the top 50-FV players at the end of last year) for a while, considering him more of a soft skills left fielder than a likely star, noting Brandon Nimmo as a potential comp who became exceptional. It looks like Carter is, too. We don't expect he'll perform to the level he did during his god-like call-up — .306/.413/.645 in September, .300/.417/.500 in the playoffs — but he'll produce enough to be a very good left fielder in the event Leody Taveras hangs around to play center for the foreseeable future. 
Carter's plate discipline is incredible, and his nerves of steel were on display during the 2023 postseason, when he was very difficult for some of the best arms in baseball to make chase. He also has fantastic plate coverage and better ball-striking power on his more conservative swings than you'd expect from such a gangly and thin athlete. We don't think the league has taken complete advantage of Carter's issues against breaking stuff yet, especially back foot breakers, against which he was vulnerable in the minors. Carter struggles to contact these pitches when they're well-executed (he actually had many more swings-and-misses than balls in play versus breakers in 2023), but he can punish the ones that don't quite finish. 
Defensively, Carter does some things very well in center field and other things not so well. He’s great at running down balls in the gaps, and at finding the wall and then the baseball again as he approaches the warning track. His reads on balls hit in front of him aren’t as crisp (he'll make some diving plays in front of him that other center fielders make standing up), and his hands and ball skills are below-average. His arm plays above its raw grade because Carter’s exchange is so quick — he knows his best chance to hose someone is to get rid of the ball quickly and accurately, so he does. He’s definitely a fit in center field, but he isn't a Gold Glover or anything like that, and not as good as Taveras, which probably means Carter will be one hell of a left field defender for the next little while. Carter lacks the prototypical power of a starting left fielder, but his plate skills and speed are going to elevate his OBP enough to make him a very valuable player.","kn1p4E5tdTY","27790"

An extra tick of velocity compared to 2023, plus an improved changeup and command, elevated Jones into the top 20 overall prior to his graduation from rookie status. 
His four most used offerings are all generating at least a plus rate of swing-and-miss as Jones pumps his upper-90s fastball past hitters at the belt and then toys with them with either his cambio or slider. An elite on-mound athlete who was also a draft prospect as a third baseman, Jones' feel for release consistency has improved substantially since his time as a prospect. He's a little undersized, and all that's keeping him from the 60 FV tier, which is normally occupied by the best couple of pitching prospects in the entire sport, is some apprehension about his durability and a potential command regression because of how much effort it takes him to produce this kind of velocity. Regardless, he looks like an impact starter who's going to make several All-Star teams, a dream draft-and-dev success for a franchise that badly needs those to compete.",,"27863"

While those changes may have been aimed at eliminating PCA's upper-zone swing-and-miss issues, they have instead resulted in a power surge over the past couple seasons the likes of which he'd never previously displayed. After sending out 16 bombs at Low- and High-A in 2022, he upped the ante in 2023 with 20 homers in roughly the same number of games, this time at Double- and Triple-A, where he was far younger than most of his competition. The upper- and outer-zone whiffs are still present, though, and while we think PCA is going to get to his power, it's likely that his hit tool and OBP skills will wind up comfortably below the big league average. That's been the case so far as Crow-Armstrong approaches 100 big league plate appearances.
But of course, PCA boasts some of the most electric center field defense in the sport and could be a nearly three-win player on that basis alone. His proficiency and fearlessness on the basepaths is undeniable – a significant portion of his doubles in 2023 were of the hustle variety – and as long as he's doing <em>something</em> offensively, he is going to be an impact big leaguer. He'll likely continue to be challenged by the upper-zone heaters that have long confounded him at the plate. If he can plug that hole over time, he'll be a five-tool superstar. More likely, he'll have some 20-25 homer seasons amid a ton of strikeouts and a low OBP, with peak years resembling Mike Cameron's (though almost certainly not to that level of annual consistency). He has assumed the Cubs' everyday center fielder role during Cody Bellinger's injury absence and initial return, but it's feasible he'll effectively be in a timeshare with Michael Busch and Patrick Wisdom as a fully healthy Bellinger shuttles back and forth between center field and first base.","W3x5HtsbK0U","27769"

The Cardinals have pushed him pretty aggressively and Winn began 2023 as a 21-year-old at Triple-A Memphis, where he slashed .288/.359/.474 and hit an uncharacteristically high 18 homers in 105 games. Winn made his big league debut late enough last year to retain prospect eligibility, which he has blown through in 2024, as he broke camp with the big league club. He graduates from rookie status playing about as well as expected. There will likely be meaningful power as Winn ages deeper into his 20s. For now, it's impressive that a small 22-year-old is holding his own at this level. Winn's hands on defense are only average, but he's a premium athlete capable of making acrobatic plays, and he has an elite arm. Because of his rare level of athleticism, the ceiling on Winn's power separated him from some of his contact-oriented middle infield peers on the Top 100. It will probably take a couple of years before he really peaks, but Winn projects to be a well-rounded player and a foundational piece in St. Louis.","C_Epe1MsiS8","27479"

His pro career got off to a delayed start because of multiple health issues. He was diagnosed with myocarditis shortly after signing, which kept him out for all of 2021, and then a high grade hamstring strain put him on the IL for the first half of 2022. It wasn't until that June, two years after he was drafted, Kjerstad was finally cleared to be sent to an affiliate. He has been an offensive force of nature since returning to the field. He's a career .304/.386/.526 hitter in the minors who had 58 extra-base hits in 122 games before he made his big league debut during the last few weeks of the 2023 season. He's been up and down a couple times so far in 2024 and was promoted to Baltimore again a couple of days prior to list publication.
Kjerstad has monstrous all-fields power and enough feel for the barrel to weaponize it even though he tends to chase. His hands ignite in the blink of an eye, allowing him to turn on inside pitches with power and also to let outside pitches travel deep into the hitting zone before crushing them the other way. He has fantastic plate coverage but expands the zone too much, which is why he's projected as having a slightly below-average hit tool here. 
Kjerstad is still going to have enough in-game power to support an everyday corner profile despite a potentially low OBP, and his defense has surprisingly improved. When he first returned from injury in 2023, it looked as though he'd end up in the 1B/DH bucket. But Kjerstad has looked more mobile and athletic as he's gotten further away from his health and injury issues, and he now has average range and footspeed, though he still is not a very comfortable outfielder. It might a trade to clear the deck for Kjerstad to play every day in the near future. As long as their outfield is as crowded as it is right now, Kjerstad's role will most likely be in a timeshare with Ryan Mountcastle and/or Austin Hays. If Cedric Mullins' 2024 struggles continue and force him into a speed and defense role down the stretch, more PAs might open up. Kjerstad's lack of plate discipline gives his profile an element of risk, more than is typical for someone who has performed in the minors the way he has. But his combination of bat control and power is very special and should enable him to be a heart-of-the-order force at peak.","Kw_nkwAjQEs","31166"

As a minor leaguer, he would show you anywhere between 92-97 mph and it appears he's settled into the lower part of that range, at least for now. He generates a ton of fastball chase because of the pitch's angle and his delivery's deception. The thick-thighed southpaw throws from a low three-quarter arm slot and further lowers his release point by way of a deep knee bend as he lunges toward the plate. 
Harrison started 2023 at Triple-A and spent most of the year there (minus a few weeks on the IL with a hamstring injury) before joining the Giants’ big league rotation in late August. He broke camp in the rotation this season and has amassed enough innings to graduate from rookie status. Harrison has been surprisingly efficient so far as a big leaguer after he was rather walk-prone early in his pro career. He still has a big bending breaking ball that works best as a show-me pitch versus lefties, but his most-used secondary is now his changeup. Again, Harrison's changeup plays because of how often it's chased more than because of its pure swing-and-miss action. It often finishes in the middle/bottom of the zone rather than down and to his arm side like a normal changeup. We've made no changes to Harrison's offseason evaluation based on how he's looked so far. He continues to project as a mid-rotation mainstay.","1AlmnfSq0xE","27758"

It's common for hitters returning from wrist injuries to experience a decline in power, and we didn't slide Mead at all on the offseason Top 100 list. Mead also underwent a pretty significant swing change in 2023, one that incorporated more movement in his lower body, and it's remarkable that he performed as well as he did amid both the injury and the changes. This was the second significant swing change for Mead in three seasons. He made his big league debut late last year and broke camp this spring on the big league roster, but the presence of Isaac Paredes at Mead's primary position, the addition of José Caballero, Richie Palacios, and Amed Rosario, and finally the return of Taylor Walls from injury led the Rays to demote Mead in May, and he's been in Durham since. He was up long enough to graduate, and he does so with some concern over whether his tendency to chase will hinder his offense. 
Healthy Mead blends plus in-zone contact with above-average power. He's much more athletic in the batter's box than he is on defense, and the way his swing unwinds from the ground up is beautiful and violent. We also love how much his top hand is involved in driving the quality of his contact. Historically, Mead has raked despite having a hyper-aggressive approach at the plate. His swing decisions against fastballs are still pretty terrible (39% chase this year), but his breaking ball chase has been close to average. Even since he's been back in Durham, he has been offering at stuff nowhere near the zone far too often. We want to be careful not to overreact to this. Mead is still only 23 and even though he's been in pro ball for half a decade, we still think his secondary skills have late projection because of his Aussie origins and the relatively brief time he's spent facing elite pitching. Corner defenders (especially middling ones like Mead) who have chase issues like this are risky no matter how well they're performing in the minors, but Mead's in-zone contact and power blend is still very potent; he's too talented to slide down the Top 100 list in a panic. 
The Rays deployed Mead at second base in their 2023 Wild Card round loss to the Rangers, but he looks better at third. He doesn't seem comfortable throwing back across his body, which second basemen have to do regularly but third basemen do not. He can be slow to approach grounders in front of him and is generally a slow-twitch athlete, but he's gotten much better at third base during the last two years and might continue to progress as he gets reps at Triple-A and big league speeds. An elbow sprain (which happened amid a throwing program to try to improve his arm strength) ended his 2022 and required a PRP injection, which is often a precursor to Tommy John for pitchers. That's a useful medical detail to file away but isn't something that's threatening Mead's profile. We still think Mead will be a good everyday third baseman over time, but obviously the Rays' situation at the hot corner is very crowded and Mead is starting to run out of option years, so he's also a prime candidate for a trade.","txl_FqwuORc","23986"

He's been a Top 100 guy at the site for each of the last couple of years because of his monster stuff but has been relegated to the back of the list due to concerns around his health, which were relevant as recently as last season, when Miller was shelved for most of the year with a UCL sprain. He was shifted to the bullpen upon his return and has been maybe the nastiest reliever in baseball so far this season, but that health history is an inextricable part of his profile, and it wasn't so long ago that he and Daniel Espino were birds of a feather in this regard. Miller has somehow had a velo spike and is averaging 100 mph with his fastball early in 2024. He's has pared down his repertoire (cutter scrapped, changeup de-emphasized) and is now almost exclusively a fastball/slider guy. Miller's slider has crazy vertical depth for an 89 mph pitch.

Knee and hamstring surgery effectively knocked him out for the 2020 season, but Lee raked in his sophomore and junior years with a great Cape Cod stint sandwiched in between. Before the 2022 draft there was again industry buzz that some teams were off him because of his medical, and he fell deeper into the draft than is typical for a college shortstop with his statistical track record. Minnesota sent Lee to High-A almost immediately and he raked. He had a very solid first three months of 2023 at Double-A Wichita before his performance and visual scouting look fell off late in the year at Triple-A St. Paul. There was a definite physical regression for Lee, who looked a little less trim and rangy than he did in 2022. Because of his size (Brad Miller is a fair body comp), straight line speed (he's heavy-footed from home to first, in the 4.5s) and his medical, clubs have tended to project him to third base, and Lee began to see time there about once a week after he was promoted to St. Paul. He began the 2024 season on the IL with a herniated disc that kept him out until the end of May. 
Lee is still mostly playing shortstop, and our projection has always been a little more bullish about him staying there, at least for a while, largely based on Lee's great feel for the position. He has quick actions and is adept at positioning his body to be ready to throw as he fields the baseball, his transfer is quick, and his internal clock is well-calibrated. He finds creative ways to make timely, accurate throws, and even though it sometimes looks awkward and like he is making the play harder than it needs to be, Lee makes a lot of fun, flashy plays for a bigger dude with mediocre range. We're less certain about his shortstop projection now than we were a year ago, though, because he looked less mobile later in 2023 and has now had a disc issue that hearkens back (ahem) to his pre-draft medical concerns. 
Lee's explosion in the batter's box has also dialed down a bit. He's still swinging hard from the left side, but elements of his cut have been tardy upon his return from the IL, and his righty swing is far less explosive. This could be due more to time off from hitting than physical malady; it's something to watch as his 2024 drags on. Carlos Correa's resurgence makes it less imperative for Lee to be ready as soon as possible. It may be more important for opposing teams to evaluate him as a trade target. The same injury-related considerations that have us approaching Lee's prospect grade and everyday player forecast with a light touch might also be reason for teams to be apprehensive about making him the centerpiece of a deal.",,"31595"

With so many other infielders also in the upper-level mix for playing time, chiefly Gunnar Henderson and Jackson Holliday, the Orioles traded Ortiz as part of a package for Corbin Burnes. His profile was initially rooted in his plus combination of defense and feel for contact, but in 2023, he traded some of that contact for meaningfully more power. Ortiz’s underlying contact quality took a leap across the board, most notably his hard-hit rate, which rose from 31% in 2022 to 46% in 2023. This was coupled with a noticeable shift in his physicality, as Ortiz looked bigger and stronger. Ortiz’s contact rates, both overall and in-zone, dropped a tad compared to 2022 and he’s a bit chase-prone, but his well-rounded offensive output should clear the relatively low bar for middle infielders. 
While a capable shortstop, Ortiz is not quite the defender that Willy Adames is. Unless Adames is also traded, Ortiz is more likely to wind up playing second base, where he is an exceptional, Gold Glove-caliber defender. His range and acrobatics are rare for that position. If not for Rhys Hoskins’ presence at first base, Milwaukee’s current projected group of Adames, Ortiz, and Brice Turang would be one of the best infield defenses in baseball. Ortiz projects as an everyday middle infielder at either position and is talented enough to be a part of Milwaukee’s core for the next half decade.","oLEMiIO78pw","25493"

Teams mostly understood his commitment to ASU to be pretty loose, and Keith signed for an over-slot $500,000 as a fifth rounder in the 2020 draft. Injuries limited him during his first two full seasons in the Tigers org, but he mashed when he played. He looked great during the 2022 Arizona Fall League, then clubbed nearly 70 extra-base hits in 126 games throughout a fully healthy 2023 split between Double- and Triple-A. During his stay in Toledo, Keith began to see more time at second base rather than his native third. He's a bad defender at both spots but has a much greater chance at becoming passable (read: hidden) at second, where some of Keith's issues with throwing are masked. 
Keith's offensive prowess is rooted in his raw power. He nearly killed managing editor Meg Rowley and her laptop in the auxiliary press box during his Futures Game BP when two or three of his dingers clanged off the face of the deck above her. Keith clocks fastballs well and is short to the top of the strike zone. He struggles with soft stuff in the bottom third of the zone, especially changeups, which he tends to swing over the top of. This will likely prevent Keith from being a plus contact hitter, but I don't view him as being so risky in this regard that it threatens his whole profile. He's a flawed player and his WAR output will be impacted by his lack of position, but Keith is going to slug enough to profile as either a DH or bad-gloved second baseman.
Keith has bulked up considerably since signing, and the effects of his increased size are evident on defense. Once a fair bet to stay on the middle infield, he is now fighting just to stay at third. He is stiff and bulky, his actions are well below average, and while he shows you a big arm when he gets to wind up and really let it eat, he struggles to throw from odd platforms. It's feasible a team could live with him playing third base situationally, but it's not ideal, and Colt is a 30-grade defender right now. He is similar to Nolan Gorman in the way he has trended athletically on defense, but there's enough bat to support an everyday fit at the bottom of the defensive spectrum. Despite the underwhelming defensive forecast, Detroit clearly likes what they have in Keith: In January, the Tigers signed him to a six-year, $28.6 million extension with three club options and incentives that could push it's value to $82 million.","XpRBXuPDNN8","27899"

He still has some warts, which I'll talk about in a second, but his overall offensive ability should provide enough impact for him to break the profound University of Arizona hitter drought the game has experienced since Scott Kingery's swoon. 
Wells' swing is beautifully connected from the ground up. The blend of his barrel control and the natural lift in his swing gives him a potent contact and power combination, which will likely make him a valuable hitter even if he ends up being unable to catch. His peak exit velos weren't incredible in 2023, but Wells was working back from a rib injury that may have sapped his explosiveness. In the past, I've been concerned about his inability to make contact with fastballs running up and away from him, but he wasn't as helpless against them when you put on his tape from late in 2023 tape. Anyone with a swing as uphill as Wells' is going to swing underneath a lot of fastballs in that location, but he snatches his fair share of them and is dangerous enough in this part of the zone to alleviate some of my past apprehension. More of a problem during his big league stint toward the end of 2023 was Wells' tendency to chase and swing over the top of changeups. Wells was a steady 11% (or better) walk rate guy in the minors, but he seemed to be pressing during his cup of coffee. I'm inclined to bet that his true skill level is closer to his historical norms. 
Even an average hit/power combination would be a big deal if Wells can remain a catcher. Ever since a severe shoulder injury he suffered in high school, Wells has had issues throwing out runners. Runners have had a 82% success rate against him in pro ball (343 total stolen bases in 308 pro games). His pop times are fine (1.90 during his big league trial per Baseball Savant), but his footwork is inconsistent as he leaves his crouch, causing inaccurate throws. This issue needs long-term attention, but Wells has made considerable progress as a receiver and ball-blocker despite his below-average hands and limited lateral mobility, the result of his one-knee style. I'm now more bullish than I've ever been about him staying behind the dish. It looks like the Yankees might carry three catchers on their big league roster, which would give them the flexibility to catch Wells when the starting pitcher is good at holding runners and give him some run in left field on other days (he played left a little bit in college). This is a great way to get Wells' feet wet as a big league defender while also getting his bat into the lineup regularly, but ideally he'll improve enough as a thrower to simply be the primary catcher for the better part of the next half decade.","nze40aRSOeo","27562"

Scott began the 2023 season on the IL with an oblique strain, but once he was healthy, he was on the expressway to Queens, climbing three levels across just 19 starts en route to a spot on the offseason Top 100. He debuted in the bigs not long before list publication.  
Scott has a huge wingspan and gets way down the mound, traits that combine to give him huge extension and a shallow approach angle. His fastball really jumps on hitters, and he misses a ton of bats with it at the top of the zone even though it's technically a sinker. He's always had a pretty juicy slider, and he and the Mets have done well to demarcate his two breaking balls; Scott now has an upper-80s cutter and a slightly slower sweeper-style slider. Not only does he have two distinct breakers, but last year Scott seemed to have altered his changeup into a firmer split (its average velo increased by about five ticks, often 84-88 mph), giving him a very complete mix. Some of what Scott is doing mechanically is pretty violent (he has a nasty head whack), and you can see why he was 'penned in the past, but he's thrown a ton of strikes in pro ball (this is definitely a control over command guy) and has mostly proven he can sustain an impact fastball across a starter's load of innings. From a craftsmanship standpoint, Scott is remarkably advanced for a guy who didn't start in college. I had him projected for a 2025 debut during the offseason because of his 40-man timeline, but the Mets thought he was ready for prime time already. He projects as a mid-rotation starter.",,"30107"

I've been of the mind that his elite center field defense would cause the Red Sox to deploy him out there regularly, but he looks quite good at short and the org has a much clearer need there than in the outfield, so perhaps we'll see him do a mix of both for the long haul. His acrobatics are apparent at both positions, but especially in center, where Rafaela would be an all-world defender. Most super skinny SS/CF prospects wind up in the outfield due to a lack of arm strength, but Rafaela has improved enough in this area to feel more comfortable with him at shortstop regularly. 
Even at 23, Rafaela still has a sinewy, projectable frame. He's hit 20-21 bombs each of the last two seasons in the minors and is on pace to hit 15 in the big leagues this year, though you're seeing his complete lack of plate discipline rear its ugly head in the majors as he walks at a paltry 3% clip.

He ended up working 100 innings as a starter and climbed from Low- to Double-A throughout the year, with his walk rate ticking up toward the end. He opened the 2024 season in the Richmond starting rotation, but to us he still comes off as more of a reliever long-term. 
Birdsong has significant length in his arm path that often hampers the timing of his release and command, though it also creates some deception because of how long he hides the ball from batters. He's relied more on his 12-to-6 curveball in 2024, which routinely shows above-average teeth but is very reliant on chase. It's a pitch that pairs better with his four-seamer than his slider does because of its significant depth. He can throw it out of the same tunnel as his elevated four-seamer, but presently the pitch ends up in the dirt more often than not, and major league hitters will just eliminate it if he isn't able to show he can land it for a strike with greater frequency. He's still utilizing his late-tilting slider, but it hasn't shown sharpness as consistently so far this year (its chase and miss rate stats were great in 2023) and seems to have taken a bit of a backseat to the curveball usage wise. Birdsong will also throw a changeup that often lacks notable action, and while it will show some slight depth on occasion, it projects as a show-me pitch at best. It was exciting how quickly Birdsong appeared to be developing last year, and there are still changes being made to his pitch mix, but his command has plateaued. We think Birdsong profiles as a single-inning reliever, a role where his stuff can play up in short bursts and his limited command is less of a factor.",,"31635"

He hit .282/.405/.423 in college and often worked multiple innings in relief. While he was viewed as a prospect on both sides of the ball, the teams most interested in Schwellenbach before the draft were the ones that thought he was only scratching the surface on the mound after having pitched for just a year in college. During his 2021 season at Nebraska, his fastball averaged 95 mph across most of the season but dipped down to 93 in his last two starts, and it was later determined that he needed Tommy John, which delayed his pro debut by a full year. Only when he was done rehabbing in 2023 did Schwellenbach begin his foray into starting. An IL stint (shoulder inflammation) limited him to 65 innings, but by the end of the season, he had stretched out to five and six innings per start and held mid-90s velocity the whole time. A hot start at High-A Rome in 2024 led to two quick promotions, first to Double-A Mississippi and then straight to Atlanta, where Schwellenbach has made three starts leading up to list publication. 
Schwellenbach has had a one-tick velo bump so far in 2024 and has also added a cutter to his already robust repertoire. He employs a slider-heavy approach against righties and throws the kitchen sink at lefties. He doesn't have dominant stuff right now, but you can project on some Schwellenbach's weapons (the changeup and brand new cutter, especially) because he's a good athlete who is new to starting. He's reached the big leagues just about a year after he transitioned into a rotation, which is incredible. I wonder what kind of innings limit he might be on given that he's never been stretched out to anything close to 100 innings in single season, but I think Schwellenbach will grow into a contender's fourth starter with reps.",,"31846"

Festa has had a pretty significant velo spike in pro ball and reached Triple-A in 2023 at the very end of a solid season mostly spent at Double-A Wichita. Since turning pro, the 6-foot-6 right-hander's velocity has grown year-over-year until he reached the 94-97 mph range his fastball has resided in for the last two seasons. His approach to pitching with his heater has changed and become less efficient as, due to a lack of explosive movement on the pitch, Festa has begun to take a slider-first approach. In 2024, his changeup usage is also up; there are entire starts where he throws his fastball least of all. He often tries to get ahead of hitters with sliders that drop into the top of the strike zone, and when Festa is locating both his slider and changeup to opposite corners of the plate, each is capable of missing bats against hitters of either handedness. Both secondary pitches generated above-average rates of chase and miss in 2023 and have so far in 2024 as well. 
Festa has pitched about 100 innings each of the last two completed seasons without seeing a velocity drop off. All of his offerings are pretty firm — even his slider and changeup are often 87-88 mph — and without a pitch that more drastically alters hitters' timing, he may end up generating more weak contact than outright whiffs against big league hitters. Even though Festa is 24, his rare combination of size and athleticism might portend another gear of arm strength and/or command as he continues to refine the feel for his endless limbs. He's projected here as an innings-eating no. 4 starter on a contender who might have peak years as an impact mid-rotation guy if either his command or velocity levels up one more time. Festa could debut late in 2024, but he's more likely to permanently entrench himself on the big league roster in 2025 and beyond.",,"30056"

He has lovely all-fields ability to hit, snatching hanging breaking balls and inner-third fastballs to his pull side and spraying lots of middle-away fastballs to the opposite field. He's not quite as deft a hitter from the right side, but he's still plenty dangerous. Rocchio has not developed power as hoped even as he's filled out. He has shown progress in the plate discipline department and posted a career-high 11.2% walk rate in 2023, his second consecutive year with improvement in this area. Rocchio's body has gotten thick enough that he's more reliant on skills and acrobatic actions at shortstop than range.

,0,"Jung Hoo Lee","SFG","CF","MLB",2024,"50","Med",,"26.1138888","6' 1""","172","L","L",,,,0,"South Korea","Lee has been evaluated as a Top 100-quality prospect at FanGraphs since the 2020 KBO season and is an incredibly skilled contact and defense-oriented outfielder with important baseball lineage. His father, Jong-beom Lee, was a five-tool superstar ballplayer who stole as many as 84 bases in a single 124-game KBO season and had several 20-plus homer campaigns across a nearly 20-year career (!) in pro ball. 
Jung-hoo's career began in a precocious fashion, as he was the first player in KBO history to go straight from high school to their top level of play; he won Rookie of the Year as an 18-year-old in 2017. Since arriving in the league, Lee has a career .340/.407/.491 line, has made elite rates of contact (roughly 5.5% K% and 11% BB% combined the last two seasons), and has had a couple of years in which he also hit for meaningful power. He clubbed 23 homers and nearly 60 extra-base hits during his 2022 MVP campaign, but experienced a substantial downtick in power during an injury-shortened 2023, and he has hit double-digit home runs in just two of his seven KBO seasons. Lee's career groundball rate, which has typically hovered around a whopping 60%, has been a lurking indication of regression even during his best power-hitting seasons. 
Lee's carrying tool is his Jedi-like bat control, which he uses to deflect pitches all over the strike zone to all fields. His swing is incredibly cool and fun to watch, as Lee's open stance comes closed very early before he take a huge stride back toward the pitcher and unwinds from the ground up. As fun as his swing is, it bears a resemblance to Zac Veen's early-career swing both in terms of some of the stop-and-start nature in his footwork and the way his hands fire from a dead stop. His hand-eye coordination and ability to manipulate the barrel is amazing, however. Hitters in Asian pro leagues tend to face premium velocity less often than upper-level domestic prospects, which creates a wide error bar in projecting whether or not their hit tools will play here. Using Synergy to isolate Lee’s performance against fastballs at or above the MLB average (93 mph and up) yields just 154 pitches combined throughout the last two seasons; he slashed .268/.348/.415 against them. Bump the bottom boundary up to 94 mph and he slashed .276/.300/.379 across 96 pitches. Any higher a velocity bar and the sample is too small to glean anything. It might take a tweak to his swing, and ideally Lee will continue to get stronger as he matures into his late 20s, but his feel for contact is an exciting foundational skill on its own. 
If Lee doesn't end up hitting for power, his center field defense will help buoy his overall contribution to a team. He's a plus runner with above-average range and ball skills, and a plus arm. Whether he's retained that coming off a 2023 ankle injury that required surgery, teams can't know for sure. English-language reports describe his injury as an ""ankle fracture,"" and my sources indicate there was an injury to his tendon, which could mean we're talking about an avulsion fracture. Lee also had left labrum surgery in 2018. He is perhaps the highest-variance free agent on the market this offseason because there are outcomes where Lee gets stronger and does at least a little bit of everything on top of an elite hit tool, but  there are also outcomes where his center field-worthy speed is diminished and his hit tool doesn't play the same in MLB. The most likely forecast is somewhere in the middle, and here Lee projects as a table-setting center fielder without much pop, though whatever the case, the Giants should be prepared to make a multi-year project out of Lee so he has time to adjust in the same ways Ha-Seong Kim has.","hQYbPw53SuA","33824"

It's the second consecutive camp where he's arrived having improved his conditioning. Pages is an explosive swinger with a very powerful lower body, which he often gets deep into during his swings. His bat path is geared for huge lift, with some of the most consistent and extreme launch in all of professional baseball at 22-25 degrees on average the last two seasons. Pages' exit velocities are surprisingly low considering his in-game power output (he averaged 25 annual bombs across his ages-18-21 seasons) and the ferocity of his swings. Anecdotally, dips like that sometimes coincide with drastic changes in player physicality like what Pages has shown (Lewin Díaz is a recent example), and he might still progress in this way. Pages is probably always going to strike out a lot; it's inherent in his approach. He covers the inner two-thirds of the zone quite well, but his desire to pull and lift everything leaves him vulnerable on the outer edge. Pages doesn't have the raw power of a Teoscar Hernández or an Adam Duvall (Pages had 40 measurable raw at age 22), but he projects to be a similar kind of player: A strikeout-prone corner outfielder with some peak years of huge power and the occasional lean season with too many whiffs. Note the projected game power here topping Pages' raw because of how much lift is in his swing.","FDyRkfAEO0g","24816"

That's what you're tasked with as you line him up on the universal prospect continuum after his 80-game suspension, which will cost him the first half of 2024. Marte's eval and forecast has already waxed and waned some, often in lockstep with his conditioning. At times he has looked heavy and haggard, though sometimes fatigue has been a reasonable explanation for this. In 2022, he played some January winter ball for Gigantes del Cibao, saw 520 regular season plate appearances in the States, changed organizations as the highest-profile prospect in the blockbuster Luis Castillo deadline deal, went to Germany as part of Team Spain's WBC qualifier roster, and then came back to the US and played for another six weeks in the Arizona Fall League, where he looked pretty awful. He seemed rejuvenated in 2023 and slashed .279/.358/.454 split between Double- and Triple-A before debuting in Cincinnati to the tune of a .316/.366/.456 line in 123 major league PA. Marte continued to look svelte in the D.R. over the winter before he was shut down with a pulled hammy. The news of his PED suspension was the first in a slew of tough breaks for the Reds offense. 
Without the PED suspension clouding his report, Marte projects as an everyday third baseman with a shot to be a more impactful player if he finds a way to get to his power more consistently. He's has good plate coverage, only really whiffing a bunch against well-executed sliders, which is true of most hitters. He tends to cut down on the baseball and can really only elevate hanging breaking balls and pitches toward the top of the strike zone. Some of this is caused by Noelvi's swing path and some of it is caused by imprecise feel for sweet spot contact; Marte hits a lot of choppers and grounders even though he doesn't whiff all that much. To the eye, he is not as skilled a hitter as he has been on paper, and while he's incredibly physical and has above-average raw power already at age 22, Marte's swing is not actualized to get to all of it. While you can pick enough nits to stop short of calling Noelvi a future superstar, he's still a well-rounded player who has more recently looked as engaged and agile on defense as ever. Though the track record of past prospects suspended for PEDs isn't great, Marte's slide here is due more to lost time than any false sense of precision around the way PEDs may have buffed his tools. He slides behind Rhett Lowder on the Reds list and down next to Jasson Domínguez (who is also missing about half the season recovering from TJ) on the Top 100.","CEY7xdrO7zA","26517"

As he crosses the rookie graduation threshold, Busch is performing to the level we expected but not in exactly the way we thought he would. He's striking out more than anticipated but getting to enough power to offset it. Much of his swing-and-miss is occurring outside the strike zone. It's not that Busch is chasing a lot, but he's struggling to contact pitches out of the zone much more than the average big league hitter (major league average O-Contact is 56%; Busch is at 48.4%). There's bigger hit tool and on-base ceiling here than Busch has shown to this point. He's been selective for his entire career and as that skill starts to surface at the big league level, it will buoy both his OBP and contact abilities. Again, Busch has been good so far, but he'd feel like a more stable hitter if he weren't striking out a third of the time, especially since he's officially a 1B/DH-only defender now.","2A597xbLtFA","26319"

Pitchers with changeups as good as Thorpe’s and who throw as many strikes as he does tend to be high-floor propositions who pitch forever. His low-80s changeup, which he locates at will, has a ton of tail, and his ultra-short arm stroke helps trick hitters into seeing fastball out of his hand. The effectiveness of Thorpe’s slider (more average in terms of raw stuff) and fastball (below-average at just 90–92 mph) is enabled by his precise feel for location. He can sink his fastball down and to his arm side, or run a four-seam version of it past hitters at the letters. The Yankees coaxed a little more heat out of Thorpe (who sat 88–91 in college) during his time in their org, but not enough to give him impact velocity. The White Sox have not demonstrated a consistent ability to do that, and the 91-93 mph he showed during his 2024 spring run with the Padres may be all the velo he ever has. Thorpe will throw the occasional cutter or curveball in an obvious fastball count to keep hitters guessing, but those pitches don't currently have any more utility than that, though we think the cutter eventually will. This is a very polished 23-year-old. We're talking about plus command of a plus-plus changeup here; Jeremy Hellickson and Marco Estrada are fair recent comps.",,"31967"

His athleticism (he was a two-way player at Minnesota), simple delivery, and relatively easy arm action gave teams confidence in his ability to start despite a smallish frame and inconsistent command at that time. 
Meyer passed his first professional tests with flying colors, finishing the 2021 season with a 2.41 ERA at Double-A Pensacola. His fastball velocity was down, ""only"" in the 94-97 mph range, and it has never really returned to that elite, early-2020 level. Meyer still seemed poised to make his big league debut in 2022 when he began having injury issues, first ulnar nerve irritation and then a late-summer Tommy John that cost him all of 2023. When Meyer got going at the start of 2024, his velocity was down a tad. He still managed to put together some good big league starts before he was somewhat surprisingly demoted to Jacksonville, where he's starting every Friday rather than every fifth day as a way of controlling his innings load coming off the TJ. He'd have to spend the majority of the season in the minors for the Marlins to alter his free agency timeline. With the team poised to take a seller's posture at the deadline, Meyer feels like a lock to be up at some point and pitch enough to exhaust rookie eligibility and accrue a year of service. Meyer's velocity has trended up a bit in his last couple of starts before list publication, sitting more 93-95 and touching 97 rather than living in the 92-94 mph range for much of an outing. His slider's effectiveness has been collateral damage; it's playing like a merely plus offering now. Without peak velocity, Meyer looks more like a perfectly fine fourth starter than an impact front-end arm.","k7_4XDiW_aE","27474"

Back at Norfolk to start 2023, he threw more strikes, entered the Top 100 list, and made his big league debut shortly before this org update. 
Povich's statuesque frame and effortless delivery are innings-eater characteristics, and his ultra short arm action and his body's direct line to the plate have allowed him to throw plenty of strikes, save for his Triple-A blip last year. He lacks great tactile feel for release; Povich's style of attack is more about control than command. Povich added a cutter in 2023 and now has three breaking pitches with glove-side action that run the gamut in terms of shape and velocity. Unpredictability and deception are a huge part of how he succeeds. His arm stays tucked behind his body until the very last bit of his delivery prior to release, and it makes hitters very uncomfortable. Most of Povich's secondary offerings generated an average or slightly better rate of swing-and-miss in the minors, which has predictably dialed down to average during his small big league sample.

Scott slashed .303/.369/.425 during the regular season and .286/.388/.417 in Arizona; he also stole 112 bases combined between the two. Injuries to Lars Nootbaar, Tommy Edman, and Dylan Carlson forced the Cardinals to skip Scott over Triple-A completely and put him on the 2024 Opening Day roster. He flopped in the majors for a couple of weeks before being sent back to Triple-A Memphis once Nootbaar was healthy and has slowly begun to get going on offense again. Scott is an 80 runner with fabulous feel for center field and double-killing gap-to-gap range. His defense alone would be enough to make him a major league role player. Scott is rail thin and not especially strong, but he makes an above-average rate of contact and has other soft skills like baserunning and bunting that act as the cherry on top of a catalytic offensive profile. He reached safely on 17 bunts last year, which is reminiscent of TJ Friedl, who had a lot of success in 2023 as a very similar player. Premium center field defense and speed give Scott a fourth outfielder's floor, while his rate of contact and pesky bat-handling abilities elevate his profile into more of a regular role, especially if he can get stronger.",,"31349"

While he hit a robust .300/.417/.520 (with a .390 BABIP) at Norfolk last year and overall had a .280/.399/.498 line at Triple-A in 114 career games, there were visual, as well as underlying statistical issues, that had Eric projecting Cowser as a good player rather than a great one even before Cowser hit .115/.286/.148 and played his way off the Orioles' playoff roster in 2023. So far this forecast has been light. Cowser showed up to 2024 spring training having added a grade of power to his game. He had an incredible 2024 Grapefruit League, broke camp with the big league squad, and is hitting for enough power to be an everyday-quality offensive player even as his strikeouts have climbed like they were forecast to here at FG. 
Let's recount what Eric perceived to be Cowser's strengths and weaknesses entering the season, and examine how those have played out so far. The gap between Cowser's overall chase rate in 2023 (way better than league average, minors included) and his two-strike chase rate (substantially worse than average) is indicative of a very selective approach, and perhaps also of predetermined takes early in the count. This was interpreted as an indication that Cowser's elite minor league walk rates would come down once he was in the big leagues. So far that has been correct. Cowser's 2024 chase splits are still pretty dramatic (27% overall, 44% with two strikes), and his walk rate has come down from the 16-17% he showed throughout the minors to 9.6% so far in 2024. 
Eric also wasn't forecasting an average or better hit tool here. Cowser ran a 70% contact rate and 80% in-zone contact rate in 2023 (combined at Norfolk and Baltimore), both of which are below the big league outfield average. Eyeball scouting corroborated this. Cowser's head was flying all over the place throughout his swing and Eric singled out a tendency to swing over the top of soft stuff that finishes in the lower half of strike zone. This has also held true so far in 2024, as Cowser is striking out nearly 30% of the time (38% vs LHP) and struggling badly with offspeed pitches. 
Cowser's wrists are very strong and he's capable of doing damage even when the rest of his swing is not well-timed or connected, including to the opposite field. He had a 47% hard-hit rate combined between Norfolk and the big leagues last season (the major league average for outfielders in 2023 was 39.4%), but his peak exits were closer to the big league average. There was impressive pound-for-pound quality contact here, but not big raw juice. That has changed. Cowser is hitting the ball harder in 2024, with his hard-hit rate is up over 50% and his max exit velos comfortably plus. At age 24 there was an assumption that Cowser was done developing in this way, but he's instead taken a leap. Cowser is being deployed in such a way that three quarters of his at-bats come against right-handed pitching and he's been a plus left field defender. If you like, you can mentally map him right next to Astros outfielder Jacob Melton on the Top 100 list since those two have similar skill sets now that Cowser's power has ticked up. There's been no change to the FV grade here because Cowser graduated pretty early in 2024 and Eric just has to live with being wrong if indeed Cowser keeps performing like this.",,"29591"

He covered three levels in 2023 and finished at Triple-A Sugar Land, posting a cumulative OPS of .880 with 25 homers and 27 steals in 31 attempts. In 2024, he hit 10 homers in the first half of April, made his big league debut, and has been up and down depending on the health of Houston's other outfielders. 
Loperfido hits out of a crouched, square stance with his hands set up high, and has a direct, adjustable path that sprays contact to all-fields. He can really elevate pitches with authority in the lower quadrants of the zone and hits the ball hard with meaningful consistency. He swings through a lot of in-zone fastballs and is striking out about 30% of the time at Triple-A. A lack of consistent contact is what stands between Loperfido and an everyday grade. 
A big part of why we're this high on him despite his hit tool issues is Loperfido's very versatile defensive profile. He has the ability to play all three outfield positions at an average level, while also showing he can handle first and second-base at a passable level. The way Loperfido can move the ball around the infield at first base is actually quite special. While he does many things at an average to solid level, there’s no single aspect of his bat or defensive ability that grades out as plus; this is a profile where the sum is greater than the raw parts.

If Goodman can improve enough as a defender to be a viable big league catcher (not even a good one, just passable), then he's going to be a primary backstop for as long as he can remain so. 
Goodman's power is sensational. He takes epic, max-effort swings and is capable of putting balls out to all fields. This style of hitting leads to lots of swing-and-miss, enough that if he were only an outfielder and first baseman, then we're talking about him more like Matt Davidson instead of Mike Napoli redux. Goodman's best throws produce plus pop times, but he doesn't handle the baseball especially skillfully and his throws are often ruined by inaccuracy or a fumbled exchange. He's still not a very good receiver but he looks a bit better this spring, and he's a gung-ho ball blocker who throws himself around in order to smother the baseball. 
A couple of list-making details that helped inform the way Goodman stacks here: He has a better chance of actually playing a premium position than the younger, seemingly more famous prospects in this system like Jordan Beck and Sterlin Thompson. His contact rates have been slightly superior to Beck's, and Goodman is able to pull the ball with power on the regular whereas Beck's swing is longer and he pushes contact to the opposite field. Goodman has the upside that all but a few prospects in the Rockies system lack, and if you believe in the old adage that catchers tend to develop late, he still has some defensive growth coming and should compete for playing time at a host of different positions relatively soon.",,"29715"

Winn was a polished slider away from making the offseason Top 100 list. He has had success (but not been dominate) in the majors even though his repertoire is missing a great breaking ball. Winn instead more often deploys a four- and two-seam fastball and his devastating splitter, which is one of the nastier ones in pro ball. Winn's upper-80s slider is hard but lacks the biting movement of a great finishing pitch. Athletically, Winn is a little bit stiff and eyeball evaluations of his relatively violent delivery have tended to funnel him toward the bullpen, but at this point his strike-throwing track record is long enough to bet he's going to start as long as he can stay healthy under a slightly larger workload. He's going to perform pretty well on a rate stat basis, but whether he generates big WAR production is going to depend on how many more innings Winn can throw and whether or not he can find a better breaking ball.",,"23499"

It is reproduced here: If you liked Craig Counsell's batting stance, then please enjoy Schanuel, whose hands start way above his head before they load in a pretty normal spot. It's common for hitters in college baseball to walk as much as they strike out, especially the good ones.

Even as a small school prospect, he was viewed as one of the more advanced bats in the 2023 draft class, and the Angels, who tended to take players of that ilk during the late-Ohtani era, made Schanuel their first round pick and had him in the big leagues before the end of the season. 
Schanuel's swing isn't sexy or explosive, he just finds a way to put the bat on the ball, and the natural uphill path of his cut helps him to hit for some power, though the reason Schanuel was left off the offseason Top 100 was because he doesn't project to hit for enough thump to be a meaningfully impactful first baseman during the next half decade or so. He slugged .868 in college last year, but it was more due to his consistency of contact than big power, and Schanuel has way less raw pop than is typical of a first baseman. As part of an offseason regimen to try to get stronger, Schanuel stood all day. He perhaps looks a little bit stronger this spring, but he's probably going to be more of a player you can ""win with"" in your lineup than one you win ""because of,"" akin to LaMonte Wade Jr. and other contact-oriented first basemen of modest impact.",,"33189"

Jimenez, who has been on the Jays 40-man for two years, owns a .388 career OBP in the minors. He likely won't sustain quite that level of bat-to-ball performance against big league arms, but this is his carrying tool on offense. Jimenez checks some, but not all, of our visual scouting boxes for contact excellence. He's short-levered and consistently on time, but his swing path leaves him vulnerable to high fastballs, which is atypical for a hitter with a statistical profile like his. Santiago Espinal (two options left) is the one most directly blocking Jimenez on the Jays' depth chart as the team's best-gloved utilityman. Ideally, Jimenez would branch out beyond just his usual 2B/SS in 2024 and be rostered as a utilityman within the next year. If he's optioned to start 2024, then he's a mandatory carry in 2025 and beyond.","efYjFq_PEP8","23782"

Cecconi has a four-pitch mix, and all of his offerings are average or better. So far in 2024, his fastball has ranged between 92-95 mph and touched 98 mph with running action and a hint of carry when he works it up in the zone. It’s not surgical command, but it projects to be a tick above average and gives him a solid fastball grade overall. Cecconi’s slider, which he has advanced feel for locating down and away to righties, ranges from 83-87 mph with big depth and late tilt. His curveball is a deep, vertical breaker that doesn’t maintain the consistent tightness his slider does. Cecconi’s changeup has taken a noticeable step forward both in terms of its usage and quality. So far in 2024, he has thrown the pitch 14% of the time between his time in Triple-A and Phoenix, compared to only 5% in 2023. He’s very effective at mimicking his fastball arm speed when throwing the changeup to give it additional deception, and its late fade and depth gives him another tool, especially against lefties.

It's about as big a major league sample as one can have to gauge a prospect without him graduating, and that xwOBA is above the big league average in center field. And Meadows is going to stay in center. Even at his size, he's a comfortably plus runner who looked crisp patrolling Comerica Park's sizable path of real estate in September. 
Meadows is a little too long and vulnerable against up-and-away fastballs to project sustained offensive performance at this level, and he swings inside a lot of righty changeups as he cheats to try to cover that pitch. Execute a belt-high fastball and soft pitch away from him in sequence, and you're either getting him out or limiting his raw power. He lacks the plus offensive attribute of an impact everyday player, but Meadows can oppo-poke soft pitches that don't quite finish, and he crushes heart-of-the-plate mistakes.

He sat just 92 in his most recent big league start but averaged 95 in his most recent minor league start prior to list publication, the latter on 10 days of rest. Hancock has a command-driven sinker/changeup profile. His low arm slot doesn't allow his slider to finish consistently and some of them have cutter shape at slider velocities.

He sat 93-96 throughout 2023 and is back there again to start 2024, and while he lacks precise feel for fastball command, his delivery is direct to the plate and Chivilli's style of fastball utility doesn't require him to dot his heater east and west. I actually wonder if Chivilli can start. He's kept his walks under control during his time in the minors, he's loose and athletic, and in addition to the power mid-80s changeup, he has a fair mid-80s slider that he can land for a strike. He threw 61 innings last year in what was largely a single-inning relief role, which he appears to be in again at Hartford early in 2024. I think the Rockies should consider stretching Chivilli out in long relief to set him up for a potential transition to the rotation if things go well. The problem is that he's already on the 40-man and it would probably take the better part of his first two option years to actually find out if that's a good fit.

He pitched exclusively as a reliever at Notre Dame and walked well over a batter per inning there, at times so wild he was benched. The Reds moved him to the rotation in pro ball and dramatically altered Boyle's arm slot, which is now much more vertical. But Boyle still walked around eight batters per 9 IP during his time in the Reds system before he was traded to Oakland for lefty specialist Sam Moll at the 2023 deadline. He mostly pitched at Double-A in 2023 but broke 2024 camp with the big league club. 
Boyle will sit 96-97 and touch 100 as a starter, and will flash three plus breaking balls — a low-90s slider and an 80-85 mph curveball — which both have vicious movement. He is often nowhere close to the zone with any of them, and is probably going to lead the majors in walks in 2024, but his size and flexibility are both typical of a big league starter. It makes a ton of sense for the A's to let Boyle try to start for as long as possible. The opportunity costs are relatively low, and a long-term attempt gives them the best shot at capturing Boyle's peak upside down the road by dealing with his horrendous strike throwing now. Big pitchers who throw really hard tend to develop a little later, and so even though the A's haven't typically been great at developing arms lately, Boyle's shot to become a starter is arguably greater in Oakland/Vegas than other places where he would have already been put in the bullpen. He's too crude for me to forecast that things will actually click, which is why I have Boyle listed as a single-inning reliever, but I still think Oakland's line of play is correct here.",,"29608"

Toronto didn't accelerate his promotion schedule to make up for the lost time, so he began 2021 back at Low-A as a 21-year-old and (mostly) flew under the FanGraphs prospect radar as an old-for-the-level player until 2022, when Barger hammered High- and Double-A pitching as a 22-year-old. Barger dealt with an elbow issue in 2023 and was limited to just shy of 90 games, and he didn't perform quite as well as in 2022. Still, by the end of the year, we were confident he felt no ill effects from the elbow because Barger's superhuman arm strength and cacophonous swing were both intact. His hack is a spectacle, lots of fun when he's on time and frustrating when he's late, utilizing a narrow, open stance and a huge leg kick. Barger can really cut it loose and is a threat to do damage on every swing, but his style is going to lead to plenty of strikeouts. 
Barger's defensive forecast has slid down the spectrum a bit, and we now think he'll play a combination of 3B and RF rather than the middle infield (which he still played some of in 2023). We think he'll be fine (but not great) at third and are excited about his potential defensive impact in right field because of his arm (which also hides some of his infield ills). We project that Barger will get to enough power to be the larger half of a 3B/RF platoon, and given Toronto's need for lefty bats and the departure of Matt Chapman, 2024 feels like his year to debut and contribute.","pe7-JHCsX2Q","24598"

As he's filled out and gotten stronger, he's stiffened some, and many of his actions on both offense and defense now feature a lot of effort and violence. For instance, Martínez often swings so hard that his ill-fitting helmet careens off his head in the middle of his hack. He's also more comfortable throwing from body positions typical at second base than he is on the left side of the infield, where he often either throws across his body or has to take a few steps to set himself before getting the baseball over there. Martínez's performance with the bat for a hitter his age has been very impressive. Still just 22, he's a career .264/.347/.415 hitter and spent the last month plus of 2023 at Triple-A Columbus. He often swings underneath high fastballs as a left-handed hitter and might struggle to maintain above-average rates of contact as he faces big league velocity.

His changeup is still incredible, a sinking and tailing ball of vapor that generated elite miss rates again last season. His fastball also doesn't have quite enough carry to miss bats in the zone, and Stone will probably need to mix some combination of his fastball and cutter together when he isn't throwing his cambio.

Though he presents a more typical starter's build/athletic look than some of the other Dodgers 40-man options, Stone is tracking like Ryan Peiot did where he struggles to find a really good third pitch.

Neither Zebby nor his delivery look especially athletic, but his line to the plate is very direct and the rest of his delivery is such a minimalistic operation that it's easy for him to repeat it. Matthews has barely walked anyone the last half decade. Since his freshman year at Western Carolina, he has walked 48 of the 1,440 batters he's faced (as of list publication), which is a (takes out magnifying glass) 3% rate. This is a fairly extreme control-over-command profile. Put on Matthews' tape and he's living in the zone with incredible consistency but isn't dotting his pitches exactly where he wants. Because of the way his fastball plays in the zone, though, that's fine for him. He generates a ton of whiffs up and to his arm side despite a downhill approach angle because of ride and deception. Matthews' slider and cutter pair nicely with one another, and some of them have dastardly late bite. His sliders have enough due south movement to play as bat-missers against lefties. That's an important component because Matthews lacks a good changeup; in fact, his changeup usage has dipped substantially this year. There's enough here to project Matthews as an efficient no. 4/5 starter, and probably soon. Given his age and build (a barrel-chested 225 pounds), the Twins might want to hit the gas here just in case, as with some other players of this sort, Matthews is currently peaking athletically.",,"31827"

He had a very efficient 2022 season in terms of strike-throwing and ended up becoming Chicago's third rounder, signing for just shy of a million bucks. 
Cannon spent 2023 split between High- and Double-A and continued to throw a ton of strikes with heavy, sink-oriented stuff. He mixes four- and two-seamers at mostly 94-95 mph, and can climb the ladder when he wants. Aside from his rarely used changeup, all of Cannon's secondary pitches have glove-side movement. His mix is super tough on righties, but he needs to sharpen his backfoot breaking ball consistency to have a platoon-neutralizing weapon. Even at his size, Cannon's delivery is consistent and repeatable. He's remade his body almost entirely since early in college and looks more lean and athletic than ever before. He likely won't have monstrous bat-missing ability. but Cannon is a high-floored no. 4/5 starter prospect thanks to his repertoire depth and command.

Injuries have been a frequent part of Millas' prospectdom. Dating back to college, he's had elbow, wrist, oblique and hip issues that have sidelined him at various points. He has the tools and skills of a primary backstop, but smaller-framed catchers like this tend to end up playing backup roles, especially if they've been injury prone. 
Millas is a plus catch-and-throw athlete with a great arm and amazing lateral quickness. He's a very rangy ball blocker and quickly recovers whatever he doesn't smother. He has a real knack for framing borderline pitches down in the zone. Millas' exchange is a little slow because he flips his hips and tries to have a clean, complete motion on every throw down, so he ""only"" posts average pop times even though his pure arm strength is plus. He used to throw from his knees quite often but that appears to have changed in 2023. Millas' 87 games caught last season was a career high for him, and he's closer to checking the box of durability. 
His biggest asset on offense is his feel for the strike zone, though Millas can also do some low-ball damage against breaking balls that don't quite finish. From the left-handed side, he employs a compact, contact-oriented, all-fields swing, while from the right side, his swing has a loftier path with more intent to elevate. He has a hole at the top of the zone big enough that big league pitchers will feel comfortable approaching him up there. With so much invested in Keibert Ruiz, and with the hard-swinging Riley Adams playing fairly well, the Nationals have a crowded group of young catchers on their 40-man. We think Millas has the look of a low-end regular or a premium backup, but because Ruiz is out of options and Adams has just one remaining, Millas is probably going to be stuck at Rochester unless the Nationals go out of their way to move one of the incumbents.",,"25643"

He finally got his first taste of pro baseball in 2021, and a season defined by gaudy stolen base totals ended with him being traded to Boston in the Hunter Renfroe deal. He's stolen 129 bases combined in his first two years in the Red Sox org and debuted in 2023. He's been up for most all of 2024 and is having a good rookie season, graduating with a 104 wRC+, which is a little north of what I'd expect him to produce throughout his big league career. 
Hamilton is a 70-grade runner who regularly gets down the line in the 4.00–4.10 second range. Minor league camera operators had trouble keeping him in frame, and his speed forces opposing infielders to rush their throws, often impacting their accuracy. This speed, combined with Hamilton's suitable shortstop defense, makes him very likely to play a part-time big league role for a long time. He made above-average rates of contact in the minors but did so as an old-for-the-level player. It thus felt prudent to round down on his hit tool projection a little bit, but Hamilton has had a relatively seamless big league transition aside from elevated chase. Vulnerable on the outer edge, Hamilton is best at turning on inside pitches, which is really the only part of the zone in which he's able to hit for power. More ""fine"" than excellent at short, Hamilton also got some run in center field during the 2023 season, but Boston's needs at the big league level have prevented that experiment from continuing so far in 2024.

He was traded to the Cubs for David Robertson in the middle of a breakout 2022 season during which Brown struck out 13/9 IP across 100 innings of work. He started the 2023 campaign with a hot streak at Double-A, where he posted a 39% strikeout rate and a 0.45 ERA over four starts. That earned him a promotion to Triple-A, where he spent the remainder of the season. He was able to maintain an impressive strikeout rate at the higher level, but it came with an uncomfortable spike in his walk rate, which more than doubled — his BB/9 jumped from 2.70 to 6.32 — and Brown failed to work 100 innings due to his own inefficiency; he was shifted to the bullpen at the end of 2023. He was sent to Iowa when camp broke in 2024 to work as a starter, and it wasn't long before he was needed in the big leagues.
Brown's lack of fastball command impacts his performance in a few different ways, because he throws a lot of them nowhere near the zone and locates too many of them at the bottom of the zone, where the pitch is more vulnerable to contact. We've tended to think Brown will eventually be a reliever, albeit a damn good one. His fastball and breaking ball (he has scrapped his slider during the spring of 2024 to work with just one breaker) both generated plus chase and miss rates in 2023, and give him two impact pitches. He'll either need to develop a better changeup or a second distinct breaking ball to have what we'd consider a starter's pitch mix, and on top of that he needs to improve his command as he approaches age 25. It feels like a tall order. For now, it looks like Brown is going to shuttle back and forth between the rotation and bullpen as needed.

Then Rodriguez pitched for Cuba's 2023 WBC team as a starter. After a rough-looking February tuneup before the actual competition began, he was nasty across 65-to-70 pitches in each of his two WBC starts, when Yariel sat 95, touched 98, and bent in a good vertical breaking ball in the 83-87 mph range. After his WBC performance, Rodriguez chose to opt out of the 2023 NPB season and focus on training to come to MLB the following year. Chunichi put him on the restricted list and Rodriguez wasn’t heard from until October, when he threw live BP for teams in the Dominican Republic and looked like his usual self. 
There may be teams that view Rodriguez as a potential MLB starter because of his repertoire depth and brief success in the WBC, but hold your horses. He started for multiple seasons in Japan and wasn't very good, with a FIP near 5.00 in 2021 prompting a bullpen move the following year. He only came into impact velocity once he moved to the 'pen and there is zero evidence that he'd be able to sustain it as a starter, in fact quite the contrary. As a relief candidate, Rodriguez is exciting and has the stuff to pitch in higher-leverage innings. His vertical fastball/breaking ball combo looks similar to Peter Fairbanks' stuff (minus a few ticks of velo) and is on par with the second- or third- best reliever coming out of a contender's bullpen.","kFqDEzmdPrc","33838"

Though his expected stats based on quality of contact are quite a bit beneath his surface-level performance, Abreu is still having a terrific rookie season and looks like a very solid corner platoon option who'll get most of the right field at-bats due to his handedness. I wrote last year that Abreu's incredible 2022 walk rates seemed inflated based on his underlying data and indeed he regressed in that regard in 2023, as his plate discipline was closer to average on the surface and under the hood. His swing is geared for extreme lift, something his relatively short levers enable since his barrel needs to take a longer path to get on such an uphill plane. This style of hitting leaves Abreu vulnerable to high fastballs, which he often swings underneath. The lack of a true plus tool offensive tool here is offset by Abreu's plus corner defense and huge arm.

One takeaway from my recent audit of the 2017 Top 100 was that the first basemen without huge power tended to produce below my expectations across their pre-free agency seasons, and that was a big part of why Manzardo slid some compared to last season's evaluation. He's still a good hitter who is going to help stabilize a position that has been subject to odd, late-season experimentation each of the last couple of years (Gabriel Arias and Kole Calhoun), but Manzardo is probably a ""win with"" first baseman rather than a 30-homer, ""win because of"" guy. He looks stronger to me this spring than he did in the 2023 Fall League and I think he clearly worked hard in the weight room during the offseason, but I checked with a front office person who hasn't seen a meaningful uptick in his measureable power this spring, and I still think Manzardo is more likely to slug closer to .400 than .450 during the next half decade.","NYcorz8qbeI","29794"

A contact machine, he struck out just twice in 69 plate appearances during his COVID-shortened 2020 college season, but Martin struggled at shortstop and only had a few games in center field before the shutdown, not enough for teams to know whether he could actually play there. The Blue Jays drafted him and sent him directly to Double-A in 2021, then traded him to Minnesota as part of the José Berríos deal. He's spent the last couple of years in the upper reaches of the Twins system before debuting at the start of 2024.
Martin has sustained his plus contact ability against upper-minors arms, but he still hasn't solidified himself as an average defender at any one defensive spot. Instead, he's mostly playing a mix of CF/LF, neither of them particularly well. While many aspects of his profile are either middling or murky, Martin is going to hit. He tracks pitches well, his swing is compact, he can move the barrel around most of the zone, and he has lovely inside-out feel that allows him to pepper the oppo gap. He'll hit for lots of contact and projects to be a versatile enough defender to play a part-time two- or three-position role of modest impact.","lj0PqRkUMCs","27462"

His walk rate (16.1%) surpassed his strikeout rate (14.9%) at Triple-A, and he posted a swinging strike rate of just 7.7%. He rarely expands the zone horizontally, but many of his hits came on offerings above or below the strike zone, so while swinging and missing is rare for Horwitz, when it does happen, it tends to be of the chase variety, primarily on high heaters and low breaking balls outside of the zone. He reached the big leagues in 2023, first for a cup of coffee in June, then to close out the season in September. Across that tiny sample, he didn't quite emulate the swinging strike, contact, or walk rates that made him a Triple-A standout, but considering the higher quality of his opponents, it would be unfair to call it a skid over such a short span; indeed, he “skidded” into the league-average range for all of the above. Where to put him defensively is more of a question. He’s a 1B/DH type, but doesn’t have the power that profile typically relies on.

Gil has since developed a good slider and his strike-throwing was fine enough that he traversed the minors and made his big league debut as a starter, but his control (especially of his fastball) realistically only fits in the bullpen. Gil had Tommy John in late May of 2022 and missed almost all of 2023, returning for two Tampa rehab starts in September. The timing of the surgery makes it very difficult for Gil to rebuild starter's innings before he runs out of options years, even though the Yankees were given an extra one due to his injury.

On paper, he isn't all that different from Zack Gelof (very similar in all contact rate and measurable power aspects) or Brandon Lowe (who generates much more consistent pull-side lift than the other two), until you compare that trio's ability to pull the ball. Tena's swing has a hitch that often causes him to swing underneath in-zone fastballs, and he peppers the third base line with slasher-style contact because he's often a little too late to do pull-side damage, where his power is biggest. Also a fairly aggressive hitter, the OBP aspect of Tena's game is likely to be below the big league average as well. 
Tena doesn't necessarily have the defensive skill set to be projected as a utility man. His exchange is incredibly quick, but the other aspects of his defense (especially his range) are not a comfortable shortstop fit, and while he's played all over the infield, he fits best at second base and might be landlocked there. Right now I have Tena evaluated as an above-replacement second base option rather than an on-roster role player. As his options run out while other middle infielders ascend through the org, rival teams looking to be active on their roster margins should be sensitive to Tena's presence on Cleveland's 40-man bubble and consider how their dev group might help to get his swing on time such that he pulls the ball more often. He'd be an interesting target if they think they can.","NGKt-rzv9sc","23691"

Two years of struggles with the Commodores resulted in just 39 total at-bats before Malloy transferred to Georgia Tech for his junior year. He slashed .308/.436/.558 with more walks than strikeouts as a Yellowjacket in 2021, his only collegiate season with actual playing time. Without a clear defensive position, Malloy fell all the way to Atlanta's sixth round pick. Within a year and a half, Malloy had coasted through Double-A and a great Arizona Fall League stint with a career OBP north of .400. The Braves traded him to Detroit for Joe Jiménez during the 2022-23 offseason, and Malloy produced another huge, OBP-driven .277/.417/.474 line in 2023 with Toledo. 
While not yet on the 40-man roster, Malloy is in position to compete for big league playing time in 2024 as Detroit's third base situation evolves. Like most of the Tigers' other upper-level position player prospects, he is not a particularly good defensive infielder. After he only played the infield in college, the Braves and Tigers have given Malloy about 50 starts in the outfield corners each of the past two seasons, and while he doesn't look especially comfortable there, his air-it-out arm strength is plus. 
Malloy's thunderous hands create big power in a short distance, and he's capable of torching pull-side contact, but I don't believe he has quite enough hit tool to be a regular corner outfielder or third baseman. Big league pitchers will bully JHM in the parts of the strike zone that he struggles to cover, and in addition to the whiffs, I worry his plate skills won't shine quite like they have so far because big leaguers know they can get him out in the strike zone. His best shot at securing a meaningful big league role includes defensive versatility that isn't yet present in his skill set. 
There is still some ironing out do to on defense, but the Tigers have the luxury of another year to do it before Malloy has to be put on the 40-man, and the field of similar players ahead of him is pretty dense, which makes me think it's more likely that Malloy will debut in 2025 than in 2024.

His expected stats based on contact quality have been better than his surface-level performance, and he's been able to maintain his excellent bat-to-ball rates and plate discipline against big league pitching. He'd perhaps be more valuable to another club where he'd more often be needed on left side of the infield. Michael Massey's frequent platoon advantage adds to this notion. But real contenders often have players occupying roles below their talent, and that's exactly what's happening here. 
From his report: Loftin's bat-to-ball ability is meaningfully good, enough to consider him a solid role player even though he lacks the power typical of a guy profiling at the positions he can play well. We're talking an 88% in-zone contact rate and 80% contact rate overall, both plus on the big league scale. His plate coverage is fantastic, especially at the top of the strike zone, where he can tomahawk extra-base contact to his pull side. Loftin still has developing to do at first base, where his footwork and hands aren't yet polished, but he's fine at second and third base. The experiment with Loftin in center field appears to be over, so he's unlikely to play a premium position. His defensive versatility and hit tool still make him a valuable role player.",,"27630"

His velocity climbed throughout the 2021 and 2022 seasons, with Arrighetti throwing four ticks harder than he did in college by the end of that span. That velo spike was sustained (but plateaued) in 2023 even as the Astros took the piggyback starter leash off and Arrighetti consistently worked five innings or more. This year, he’s added a cutter to his fastball/sweeper mix and debuted (but struggled) in the big leagues, to the tune of a 5.33 ERA (3.84 FIP) as of list publication. 
Arrighetti’s fastball tails and rides in on the hands of right-handed hitters, while his sweeper breaks in the exact opposite direction. His breaking ball command is better than his fastball command, which is part of why we have him on the starter/reliever line. Considering how loose and whippy his delivery is, and that this level of velocity is relatively new for him, it’s plausible Arrighetti could sharpen his command enough to more comfortably project as a starter. His fastball plays up because of huge extension (look how far down the mound he is at release in his video), and he might not even need precise command of that pitch to bully hitters in the zone with it because of the way it jumps on them. Really what Arrighetti has needed is a more reliable way to thwart left-handed hitters, and while the new cutter definitely gives opposing hitters something else to parse, we're not sure it’s going to be a panacea against lefties. Arrighetti also has a changeup that he barely uses, and the way he tends to approach lefties is by altering the shape of his slower breaking ball to make it more vertical, like a curveball. 
As we’ve seen with 30-year-old Ronel Blanco and his new changeup, Houston can teach an old dog new tricks, and it’s plausible Arrighetti will find yet another gear with big league instruction. He’s needed as a starter right now due to injury, but, even though our FV grade for him has now gone up a tier, on a healthy, contending team’s roster, this guy is probably a multi-inning reliever.",,"29921"

So too did injury. Martinez had Tommy John in 2021, which put him in a bit of a developmental bind since he came back in the middle of 2022, his 40-man evaluation year, and only had a couple months to earn a roster spot. He did. After moving to the bullpen post-surgery, Martinez saw his sitting velo leap into the 97-100 mph range, and a brand new splitter not only gave him a plus secondary weapon, but might end up being even better than that. He made his major league debut for Arizona in 2023, throwing 10 innings after striking out just under 30% of opposing batters he faced in his 49.1 frames in the PCL. He began the 2024 season in Reno, but a rash of injuries to Arizona's pitching staff has foisted him into one of the more meaningful roles in the Snakes' bullpen. 
Martinez throws from a three-quarters slot and his plus arm quickness allows him to generate elite velocity with seemingly minimal effort. While the fastball is hard, Martinez doesn't consistently produce plus carry or riding life on the offering, and his command likely has a below-average ceiling at best, limitations that will impact his fastball's overall quality. His splitter comes out of his hand with bullet spin (but barely any spin at all), which sometimes makes it look like a slider when it finishes to his glove-side, though it often just has bat-missing sink. There are even times when Martinez will mis-release his splitter and it accidentally tails back over the glove-side corner of the plate, freezing hitters. It's easily Martinez's best secondary offering and is extra deceptive because of the arm speed that he maintains when throwing the split. At present, his feel for the offering is mixed at best, and it’s not uncommon for him to produce multiple uncompetitive ones during an at-bat. The last pitch in Martinez’s arsenal is a slider that relies more on how late it moves rather than its amount of movement; it has slight tilting action and average bite. He's been mixing it in early in counts to keep hitters off his fastball. Martinez’s pure stuff is that of a high-leverage reliever, but his control will need to improve more in order to achieve that role.","24n0n54plvI","24453"

Parker also added a new slider in 2023 and his mid-80s splitter is arguably his most consistently located weapon. It's a starter's mix of pitches, and Parker's elaborate delivery (which generates nearly seven feet of extension) is deceptive, but it's also hard to repeat and he has been projected as a reliever here at FanGraphs for his lifetime as a prospect. The way Parker's fastball plays doesn't require him to have precise command, but his feel for location is south of what we feel comfortable projecting as a long-term starter, or as a starter on a contending team. Parker is still an impact arm of sorts, but more as a luxury swingman and long reliever like Nick Martinez or Josh Winckowski. Parker has been surprisingly efficient as a big league starter so far and had a dandy start just before list publication, but that sample is rather small compared to his historically walk-prone style and we anticipate he'll back into something closer to the double-digit walk rate he showed over the previous several seasons.

His strikeout rate has typically hovered around the 30% mark in the minors, which is actually more substantial than Outman's was at the same time, and it'd be surprising if he developed better than a 30-grade hit tool. Lithe and lean, McCray's swing packs a surprising punch for a guy with his build, and he's a very dangerous low-ball, pull-side hitter.

Dingler began catching on one knee coming off the meniscectomy and took to it rather smoothly.

He still has issues with fastball quality (due to sinking shape and movement) and command, which is why I don't have Kerkering projected as a slam-dunk contender's set-up man (45 FV) or better. Even with premium, upper-90s fastball velocity, Kerkering is more apt to lean on his incredible sweeper than his heater, which generated closer to an average miss rates all year despite its velocity.

Considering that and how hastily Hernaiz has been promoted by Baltimore (who traded him for Cole Irvin) and Oakland, his .290/.356/.418 career line in the minors is quite impressive. Hernaiz spent 2023 split between Double- and Triple-A and performed very well (133 wRC+ at Midland, 97 wRC+ in Vegas) considering he was the age of a college prospect. He has had a consistent and impressive bat-to-ball performance through the minors, with strikeout rates in the 15-17% range at every level. 
Hernaiz's best swings are electrifying. He's an explosive rotational athlete with impressive power for a 22-year-old infielder. So why not a bigger evaluation here? Hernaiz is fairly chase-prone and his bat path takes forever to get into the hitting zone. He tends to be late against velocity and either drive the ball the other way or swing through it entirely, and a lot of his contact comes on the ground. Combine this with a fairly high chase rate, and Hernaiz will have to make some adjustments in order to hit like an impact big leaguer. On defense, he has the speed and range to play shortstop, but his hands are inconsistent and he has a non-traditional throwing stroke. Most shortstops get on top of the baseball when they throw, especially on throws from the hole, while Hernaiz's arm stroke tends to be long and low. 
There's a ton of physical ability here (led by the bat speed and plate coverage) and Hernaiz is still very young. The situation in Oakland is such that he'll be given a ton of runway to develop at the big league level. He's effectively being asked to re-learn third base (where he last played regularly while he was an Orioles prospect) and deal with major league-quality pitching after just one whole season above A-ball. Things are probably going to be ugly for a little while (he’s hitting .194/.261/.194 with a 41 wRC+ as of list publication), but Hernaiz could turn into an Ezequiel Duran type whose versatility and power drive an impactful profile despite his other flaws.","R2Sr_17ruBs","26224"

The muscular 22-year-old has plus-plus power, but he’s only truly dangerous in the very middle of the zone. He ran a 64% contact rate in 2023, as Luciano lacks the barrel feel to impact pitches all over the zone. He often works to the opposite field, but this is more a product of his bat path than expert feel to hit. Chase has historically also been somewhat of an issue for Luciano, but scouts coming out of Sacramento this year have had positive things to say about the quality of his at-bats, just not his hit tool. 
If he could play shortstop, his contact issues might be liveable given how much power Luciano has, but his defense isn’t consistent enough to consider him a shortstop. He has the arm for it, but his range and hands are not as reliable. It's tough to find anyone who is comfortable projecting Luciano on the infield at all, let alone at its most difficult position. Aside from a handful of games at second base (most of those in LIDOM rather than with a Giants affiliate), he has only ever been developed at short. Now in his second option year, the time to assess Luciano at other positions is dwindling. If you believe his hit tool is insufficient to support a profile at any other position, it makes sense to try to force things at short for as long as possible. The positive outcome here is something similar to Miguel Sanó's Twins arc, where the power provides for a couple peak seasons, but near bottom-of-the-scale contact ability and frustrating defense have Luciano more often looking like a 40-grade player. Teams down the competitive continuum that may want to take a post-hype flier on Luciano sometime during the next year and a half should have a very firm idea of how they might help him improve on at least one side of the ball. We think Luciano will have a lefty-mashing window of relevance, but he isn't a foundational, impact player.","PC6wq1FXPGA","25616"

He especially crushed the Northwest League, where he hit 20 homers in just 76 games before a promotion to Double-A Hartford. He was promoted fairly aggressively to Triple-A Albuquerque (after just 50 Double-A games) at the start of 2024 and is off to a slugger's beginning there, too. 
Beck should get to enough of his power to be a useful big league role player, and he'll probably have a peak year or two where he plays more or less every day and hits 30 bombs, maybe more with help from Denver. But same as I wrote last year when he was crushing it at Spokane, I am apprehensive about projecting him to do it consistently and for an extended period of time because of the nature of his swing-and-miss. Beck had more swinging strikes than balls in play last year in a sample that was generated mostly at High-A. His 64% contact rate would rank near the very bottom of the big league outfielder population alongside players whose production is a pretty good comp for what I expect from peak Beck, like Brent Rooker and Luke Raley. Beck is a powerful, tightly wound athlete with thunderous raw power and above-average speed. His swing takes a long time to enter the hitting zone, often leaving him late on fastballs either at the belt or on the outer third of the plate. He has the pop to do opposite field damage when he actually makes contact with pitches away from him, but he whiffs out there a ton already even though he isn't yet seeing big league-level velo consistently. 
Beck is playing a mix of all three outfield positions but is destined for a corner in the majors. His speed gives him plus corner outfield range, while his ball skills and hands are below average. Rooker is the cleanest current big league comp for Beck from a production and profile standpoint, as the others are either toolsier (Jose Siri, Tyler O'Neill) or hit left-handed (Raley, Matt Wallner).

He worked 118 innings combined between his minor league and major league outings in 2023, pitching as a starter at Triple-A Scranton but working in a variable role for the Yankees prior to the Juan Soto trade. The high-effort nature of his delivery and his lack of size all put him in the long-term relief bucket a little more definitively than the other pitchers San Diego acquired for Soto. But Vásquez has started all year and he's throwing more strikes than we projected he would. He's also giving up a ton of hard contact. Of Vásquez's five pitches, none is generating an above-average swinging strike rate, and his FIP and xFIP suggest his ERA is due for a substantial regression. We still think he's going to be a useful part of a pitching staff and we haven't altered Vásquez's FV grade from the time of the trade or the Padres Imminent Big Leaguer article from a few months ago, we just think he's miscast in this role out of necessity and would be better in a multi-inning relief capacity.",,"24719"

He's had stretches of wildness where he's walked nearly a batter per inning, but Rodríguez is incredibly athletic, the sort of on-mound athlete for whom we think things will click over time, enabling him to be a core middle relief piece. Rodríguez's pitch mix is headlined by a fastball that regularly resides in the upper-90s and also features plus carry through the zone, which allows the offering to play despite his shotgun command. When his slider is at its best, it has a vertical, downer shape, and regularly has plus teeth. However, he has a tendency to get on the side of it, which gives the offering inconsistent shape and spin. Rodríguez has the pure stuff of a high-leverage reliever, but his lack of control and inconsistency in harnessing his mix looks to have him bound for a lesser role.

Chicago sent him straight to Triple-A after they acquired him and, though Leasure had a high ERA there, he actually showed some developmental progress with regards to his curveball usage, which ticked up at Charlotte and then again in the Arizona Fall League. 
Make no mistake, Leasure's best pitch is his fastball, which also added a few grades worth of movement in 2023. Leasure's violent, vertical-slotted delivery generates big carry on his heater, giving it in-zone bat-missing ability. His fastball execution, both with regard to throwing strikes and the quality of them, is well below average, but the pitch is nasty enough for him to get away with that. His most-used secondary is currently a hard, upper-80s slider/cutter that has variable shape because of Leasure's mechanical inconsistency. It's a nasty, late-breaking pitch that will be an effective second weapon if he can spot it more consistently as he gets comfortable with his relatively new arm strength. I'm not sure the curveball will be able to usurp it even though it theoretically should tunnel better with his fastball. It's a 12-to-6 offering in the low-80s and looked about average in the AFL. 
A fastball like this should enable him to be more than just a generic middle reliever, but there's not quite enough secondary stuff to project Leasure as a setup man or closer on a contender. He stands a chance to work higher-leverage innings for the Sox in the coming season.",,"29950"

Herz has an extreme crossbodied delivery that aids in deception and makes him a nightmare for lefty hitters to pick up. His stride direction looks more like Andy Pettitte’s pickoff move than it does a traditional delivery. His huge extension and deception allows a fastball that averages 91.5 mph to play above its radar reading when it’s located in the upper quadrants. Herz throws from a high three-quarters slot with a lengthy arm circle and a pronounced wrist hook. It's tough for him to repeat, and he struggles with walks. His slider ranges between 81-86 mph; it's a short, quick offering that is more effective at staying off barrels than it is generating high whiff totals. The headliner here is Herz’s changeup, which routinely has 10 mph of velocity separation from his fastball. It's thrown with identical arm speed, has late depth, and is capable of regularly slipping under the bats of both righties and lefties. His overall command falls short of a long-term starter role (though he continues to start in 2024), but Herz’s plus-plus changeup and passable fastball/slider give him leverage-reliever upside.","LssvDo6ZKq8","26389"

Other than him continuing to improve his conditioning (his body looks way different than when he was in college) and moving a little further to the first base side of the rubber, there has only been one major change to Slaten's operation: his cutter usage. It's become his most used offering and a way for him to get some early-count groundballs, whereas he was much less efficient pitching primarily off his fastball. His slider is still his money pitch, an 81-86 mph two-plane nightmare garnering swinging strike rates north of 20% at the big league level.

He first appeared on the International Players section of The Board last year when he posted the second-highest swinging strike rate in NPB behind Livan Moinelo (a name to stash away for next offseason). Despite sitting mostly 91-94 throughout the season, he ranked fourth in K% in 2023 among pitchers who threw at least 40 innings (32.4%) because his fastball misses a ton of bats at the letters thanks to its flat approach angle and vertical movement. The supremely athletic 5-foot-8 lefty has a due north arm slot that helps impart a nearly perfect back spinning axis on his fastball. Sometimes pitchers with this high a slot end up having a steep, downhill fastball angle, but Matsui's lack of size helps counterbalance that, and his bouncy on-mound athleticism should enable him to hold up across a typical 60-inning big league relief workload despite being so small. 
As pedestrian as Matsui's fastball velocity is, his splitter is quite firm (usually 86-88 mph). It's his most-used secondary pitch; his usage of it has increased in each of the last several seasons and grew to a career-high 35% in 2023. Matsui also has a true two-plane mid-80s slider that is of big league quality, but his usage of it was cut nearly in half in 2023, way down to 10%. It’s a good looking pitch and probably deserves more air time. Despite lacking typical big league reliever arm strength, Matsui looks like a very stable and versatile big league middle reliever. I've gassed his FV a little bit above my typical 40 FV for a role like this because Matsui's mix should enable him to get hitters of both handednesses out. He lacks the monstrous stuff I associate with a contender's set-up man or closer, but he's more than a generic sixth-inning guy.","p23yG-9wJ18","33826"

Berroa struck out 37% of opposing hitters at Double-A Arkansas in 2023 and has the raw stuff to pitch in the back of a bullpen if he can dial in his 30-grade control.  
As the prophecy foretold, Berroa was finally moved to the bullpen after making five starts at the beginning of 2023 and joined the legion of wild arms who are now leading with their slider and using their fastball as a two-strike chase pitch. The line on his fastball, when located at the letters, sets his slider up to freeze hitters and then dive into the zone after they've given up on it.

When Smith is locating to that high, arm-side location, he is nearly unhittable, but he doesn't repeat his violent delivery very well and he scatters fastballs all over the place.

Roupp has one of the better curveballs in all of baseball. It bends in around 77 mph with a ridiculous amount of depth. It has in-zone and bat-missing utility against hitters of either handedness and, especially in relief, it is likely to be the pitch Roupp throws most of all. Like a lot of Giants pitching prospects, Roupp has a drop-and-drive delivery and low-ish arm slot, which together create a shallow approach angle on his sinking fastball. The line on his heater pairs nicely with his curveball and he's going to be able to sneak it past hitters at the belt.

Clase is striking out a ton and wholly unable to get on top of high fastballs. But he's also incredibly strong for his size, he's an explosive rotational athlete whose swing often finishes with his bat in the dirt behind him, and he has the ability to dip-and-rip low pitches with authority. His feel for the outfield isn't great, especially on balls hit in front of him. Elite speed helps mitigate this issue enough to profile in center and will enable Clase to make an impact on the bases. Considering he's only 22, it's fair to allow for long-term projection on Clase's defense and his ability to hit, though more in a way that allows him to stick on a roster than be an everyday player. He's seen a smattering of big league time this season as an injury call-up.

Rosario's defense at third is highly entertaining. He loves to show off his arm and will wait an extra beat to let the ball go so he can throw it over there hard. He has mostly played third base of late. Eguy also loves to swing. He's chase prone and dying to do damage to his pull side.

His slider usage has also ticked up in 2024. The change in his approach to pitching and an across-the-board uptick in velocity hasn't made any of his pitches play like a plus bat-misser, and he relies on his slider to induce weak contact. If there's a concerning regression here, it's that SWR's changeup, once projected as a plus pitch, has looked pretty generic for the last two years. He commands it, but it lacks the powerful tailing action it showed at peak. It's usually hard for pitchers with a due north arm slot like Woods Richardson's to turn over their changeup, and as his velocity and the whip and looseness of his arm action have slipped, so too has the pure quality of his cambio.

He's dealt with more injuries in pro ball — a couple hamstring strains and an unspecified 2023 injury — and his velocity has waxed and waned somewhat, with his fastball averaging just 92 mph in 2023. Knack came into 2024 camp in better shape and was parked at 94 mph in early games. His fastball plays down a bit because of its angle, so it's important for him to throw hard. 
Knack makes heavy use of a mid-80s cutter/slider that he commands the best of all his pitches. His changeup, relegated to about 13% usage in 2023, is his best bat-misser from a rate standpoint, tailing in at around 82 mph, but Knack's feel for it is less consistent. The 2024 change in physicality here is interesting and has coincided with a velo bump that has given Knack average velocity again. I'm less likely to bucket him as a reliever out of hand, but Knack's sobering injury history is important to consider. Even if he can start, we're likely talking about a backend role, pretty similar in value to an on-roster reliever.

He can beat hitters who struggle with that location, but his fastball doesn't have quite enough carry to play as a bat-misser in the meatier parts of the strike zone. He might be better served throwing more secondary pitches. He's a backend/spot starter who may trend toward a long relief role as he runs out of option years.",,"23313"

Joyce has improved his ability to land the breaking ball in the zone, and he'll need to continue to make strides in that regard for the offering to have above-average effectiveness long-term and not be overly reliant on chase.

He totaled a little over 200 games at Norfolk before he got his first sip of the big leagues in early June. 
We have been reticent to stuff Norby because of his defense. He is a very rough second base defender, with fringe range, hands, and actions. He's gotten more corner outfield run in 2024 than ever before and Norby might be bad enough at second that he ends up a corner outfield-only guy relatively soon. What has been unexpected about Norby's 2024 is his significant uptick in strikeouts; he's hovering around a 30% K% so far. This is a little less concerning when you watch Norby, whose hitting hands remain pretty slick looking. He has pole-to-pole power, pulling hanging breaking balls and spraying fastballs to the opposite field. Norby doesn't have huge raw juice — in fact, his measurable power is somewhat underwhelming. He's more about consistently creating playable in-game power with swing loft. The lack of pull-side contact against heaters is a thing to watch here but, whereas Norby's underlying data has typically been less good than his surface stats, this year the inverse is true with regard to his strikeouts.

The Phillies drafted him in the minor league phase of the 2022 Rule 5 Draft and Dunn had a huge power breakout in 2023 at Double-A Reading, where he hit .271/.396/.506 and slugged 21 homers, more than he had hit throughout his entire career entering 2023. Reading is a hitter’s haven and Dunn was in his age-25 season, so there are good reasons to be skeptical of his sudden change in output, but his underlying power metrics also took a leap, with his average and peak exit velocities (92 mph and 112 mph, respectively) cresting above the big league average. This isn't gigantic, impact power, but it’s meaningful pop for a second baseman. Dunn swings and misses quite a bit, especially within the strike zone, but he’s a dangerous all-fields hitter because of his power and ability to catch some fastballs deep in the hitting zone and punish them the other way. 
Dunn isn't an especially good defensive second baseman, nor is he versatile. He has spent a bit of minor league time at third base (including five AFL games) and in left field, but his lack of mobility and arm strength make him a below-average, second base-only defender in my eyes. This lack of versatility is the biggest barrier between Dunn and 2024 major league playing time.

This isn't a guy hitting balls north of 110 mph or anything like that, but when Bliss makes contact it tends to be hard and he can spray it to all fields. He deals with a pretty substantial hole in the top half of the strike zone, where he is very vulnerable to fastballs and has been for a while, even when he was only striking out at a 17% clip in the mid-minors. Since he's joined the Mariners organization, Bliss' plate discipline has taken a pretty substantial leap. His swing rates haven't changed, but his chase rates (especially with two strikes) have come way, way down. It's not a premium offensive profile by any stretch, but if we line up all the game's primary second basemen, it's good enough for Bliss to be in the no. 25-40 range of that group right now. 
Bliss has continued to play some shortstop in the minors this year, but he doesn't have the arm to do it at the big league level and there are times when his arm is even an issue at second base.

He slashed .295/.366/.474 as a Diamondbacks minor leaguer prior to his offseason trade to Chicago for pitching prospect Cristian Mena. Fletcher made his big league debut in 2023 when Alek Thomas was sent back to Triple-A to rework his swing. He hit an impressive .301/.350/.441 in a 28-game big league stint, but his .263 xwOBA was considerably lower than his actual .340 mark. He has become surprisingly buff and strong for a 5-foot-9 hitter, his arms are gigantic for a person his size, and Fletcher has done so while retaining fluidity in his hips and shoulders, both of which are evident as he finishes his swing. The sweeping nature of his bat path means Fletcher does most of his extra-base damage against slow stuff he can scoop at the bottom of the zone. He inside-outs a lot of fastballs the other way, and pitchers can limit his damage by approaching him with heat. Contrary to the way he was projected in high school, he now has a power-over hit profile. 
Fletcher is an average runner from home to first and doesn't have the pure speed to play center field regularly, but his reads and routes out are good enough for him to moonlight there in an emergency.

Like Pavin Smith and Jake McCarthy, sudden buzz around Alexander should be taken with a healthy grain of salt. His tools are going to enable him to play a utility role, and he's currently in a timeshare with Kevin Newman as a result of Arizona's many injuries, but he probably isn't a late-breaking everyday shortstop prospect. 
Alexander has average raw power and is capable of doing extra-base damage the other way when he's late on a pitch (which is fairly common). He also has plus plate discipline and an all-world arm (with inconsistent accuracy) that is often the difference between turning a double play or not. Where Alexander struggles is with contact. Despite his minor league batting average track record, Alexander's late load and longer swing make him very vulnerable to high fastballs. He ran a 65% contact rate in 2023, which would rank him last among big league shortstops who saw at least 150 PA last season, right below Paul DeJong and Javier Báez, in large part because he swings underneath those heaters.

Mervis swings with a ton of effort, with his head often flying all over the place throughout. This doesn't tend to allow for sustained contact ability, and Mervis is particularly struggling to make meaningful contact with pitches in the upper, outer portion of the strike zone. His overall chase and whiff rates have increased since 2022, and they are an important area in need of improvement in order for him to consistently bring his plus raw power into games, especially given his shortcomings as a runner and a defender. Mervis could be a dangerous bench bat and may have a 25-ish homer season or two in him if he's ever given regular first base at-bats, but we're skeptical his hit tool is exceptional enough to clear the very high bar of an average first baseman.","499dV-EfclA","27845"
